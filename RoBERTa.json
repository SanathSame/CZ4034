Being in a flip-top tube makes it so convenient to use as well. I use this in about 3 ways: a light cleanser, gentle exfoliant, and clay mask. Sometimes I'll coat my face before I shower and if I don't need a full cleanse, this will be enough. At the same time, the gentle scrubbing from the powder is lovely. And of course, it also detoxifies as a clay mask. My only odd critique is that there's maybe too much product? I would personally like a 50mL version and pay less. I find that it will take me forever to finish the tube, which isn't a bad thing to complain about! Just me being nitpicky. Highly recommend!",

I didn't have any issues of it falling off either when I put it on overnight.",

   "Review": "I am absolutely enamored with this product. It's versatile, hydrating, brightening, and so much product for the price. Since I've been using it, my acne has decreased in redness and swelling, as well as the amount I get. It is very watery, so I usually do my first layer with a cotton pad then pat the remaining layers for the 7 skin method. It gives me such a nice glow when I layer it on. It's very hydrating and cooling. After a couple of layers the cooling effect kicks in and continues as I layer other products on top. It does help brighten my overall skin tone. It hasn't helped with my post inflammatory pigmentation, but it's a toner not a treatment product. If my skin needs a boost, I'll leave the soaked cotton pads on for 10 minutes, and my skin is noticeably more plump. This is also a great product to help remove any residue that might be left from rubber masks. I purchased this 4 months ago, and I still have about 1/5 of the bottle left, and I'm not stingy on how much I apply.",

You will notice your skin will start to tolerate it more, and you will reap the benefits of the Retinol! I am already noticing a little with my skin, and can't wait to see in a couple of months. My experience if I have no reaction whatsoever with Retinol, it is not strong enough for me needs. Research this, this product is the real deal.

I've tried both the lengthening (red cap) and the volumizing (black cap) and both hold a curl so well and do not smudge under my eyes! This is perfect for an everyday, natural look and I love that the brush is nice and skinny which makes application easier. I honestly don't know if I'll ever try/use another mascara again. ",

I've been struggling with bad acne/redness for over a year, so I tried several different types of products that supposedly helped with acne. There were no signs of improvement on my face; in fact, my skin was looking worse than ever before. I stumbled across an article that Charlotte Cho wrote on Korean Beauty 10 Step Skin Care. It seemed rather extensive, but the fact that most Koreans have beautiful, glowing skin made me want to give it a try. After a month of using the 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine set, I started to notice less redness in my face and less pimples showing up. My skin feels a lot softer and more hydrated, and I'm only using a spot concealer now to cover up, rather than having to use globs of foundation and concealer for my whole face (which I used to do). The only thing that slightly bothers me is the packaging of the Goodal Super Seed Oil Moisturizer. While I love the moisturizer itself, it is very difficult to get the product out of its bottle. I wish it came as a pump or a squeezable bottle.",

This cleanses it all away effortlessly. Since I use it every evening for both my face and neck, I find that it runs out pretty quickly. Definitely runs out quicker than the Hemiesh All Clean Balm. No noticeable scent. Comes with a spatula and plastic layer to store the spatula so you can scoop out the product in a hygienic way. 4 stars only because I feel we should get a little more product for the price point.",

This absorbs very quickly into skin and leaves a light, dewy look which is great as a setting spray over makeup for a fresh look. It is not as plumping as other essences like Missha Time Revolution, but it is half the price. I have not noticed any added brightening like the toner does.

I don't recommend using this alone as your moisturizer or alone for wintertime because even though this hydrated my skin and attracts water because of the humectants in the product, it won't do much to lock it in so you will lose hydration quickly. This will definitely work well in the summertime when paired with an actual moisturizer. So, in case you want to know what I use, I use this along with Solved Skincare's Coconut Water Cleansing Foam both morning and night and with Olay Complete Lotion Moisturizer with SPF 15 for oily skin during the day. I use it alone at night time, but I will need something else. Overall, a good hydrator that is very helpful that just needs to be paired with an actual moisturizer for the skincare routine to be more effective.",

I enjoyed the stick itself- the convenience, the smell, the way it foamed, the actual green tea pieces. It left my skin feeling clean but not stripped. Sadly, my skin has *never* looked worse than when using this product. At first, I attributed my constant breakouts to purging. I wasn’t experiencing any redness or instant irritation and it was fairly early so I kept using, in hopes that it would even out soon. Everyday, I woke up with new white pimples. One day I decided to do a little research and look up the ingredients. The culprit? Coconut oil! I’ve known my skin hates this for years and do my best to avoid it. I wanted this so bad, I didn’t bother to read up before purchasing. I cut this and went back to my normal routine and my skin is FINALLY on its way back to normal. ",

I use this with a vitamin c serum and I've noticed some acne scars fading but I'm not sure if this is a major factor to the serum. The texture really bothers me because it makes my face stick to the pillow and I tend to sleep on my stomach/slide and it feels uncomfortable to have my face stick to my pillow. So I started using my old moisturizer and I've been seeing the same results. I haven't been using it long so I'll keep trying it out but so far I don't see myself buying this again. ",

I use them every morning and they gently exfoliate without sending my skin into a frenzy. My skin has been glowing since using these and have not had a breakout. I have not had to do any other type of exfoliating for a month and my skin, on a daily basis, feels as if I just exfoliated (so smoooooth!). My makeup also seems to be setting on my skill flawlessly.

It gets off all the residue from my oil cleanse and makeup removal and leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft, and never tight or dried out. I have combination skin that tends towards the drier side. It’s a fantastic cleanser for me and a great value! ",

When pouring this into my hands or a cotton round, it leaks everywhere. When transferring this to a spray bottle (to try application out this way), I unscrewed the top and there was another top just like it (2 plastic tops with a hole--each hole was a different size causing product buildup in between both layers which would certainly contribute to the unintended spills and ongoing product wastage). The bottom layer of mine is permanently sealed onto the bottle--I guess I can try to cut/saw it off in order to have a better pour but this is way too much trouble. I will not buy this again. Also, I am on my 3rd bottle transfer. The spray bottle did not work b/c the spray was too strong but a small pump bottle is working much better. Still too much trouble for me!",

Having used similar acid pad-type exfoliators from other brands I expected these to work for me, but each application turned my face into a complete oil slick the next morning. Typically my skin responds very well to glycolic & lactic acids, so I don't know what the problem ingredient is but this is really not working for me. I do really like the pads themselves, so much I wish I could buy them separately, without liquid. The exfoliating side is just right-- really effective without being too aggressive, & the texture on the softer side is really great too. Really wanted these to work, but now I'm just past the return window. Bummer. ",

I used to use a cotton pad with this but now just put a few drops directly on my face and use my fingers to move it around. Sometimes, especially if I go a few days without using it, it has a strange slightest bit of a warming effect? As in, it makes my skin feel warmed. Not sure what ingredient causes this but it's not unpleasant. It's been several weeks since I started using the vitamin drops, im always late to writing reviews, but I've noticed my acne scars faded. My skin looks a little smoother the morning after (I use it at night) but mostly I've noticed the acne scars and a more even colored completion. Since I have a terrible habit of popping pimples, I would probably buy this again solely for the complexion-evening.",

The Licorice pH isn't amazing, but it does live up to the hype on Sokoglam. It's very good for sensitive skin like mines and is just moisturizing enough that it makes your face feel supple and soft after cleansing your face or coming out of the showers. It feels like water but with a very fine emulsive texture that I like. The toner doesn't have an overpowering fragrance; after awhile, you get used to it. For the price, the bottle amount you receive is worth it. I would definitely recommend trying this if you haven't found a staple toner yet. I wouldn't replace this in the long term with my staple toner, but this is a good enough toner that I wouldn't let the bottle go to waste. ",

Seriously when I first open package And it said 24 patches only I was disappointed, other brands give double at least. Well 24 of COSRX I will take over a 100 of other brands! Here is why,they are thicker, softer,blend in better with my skin and most importantly the stay on in place! Honestly I thought they fell off because , other brands were always falling off, or half on half off and I always felt them on my face. COSRX Are amazing I totally forgot they were on! I every once in a while would feel for them and yes they are there! They are very soft too. Ok the very best part is I left on overnight and the next morning took off before washing my face and it had already brought the pimple out and was starting the healing process .I put another on after washing and drying face before any makeup and by the next morning, yes that quickly no sign of pimple! Very impressed! I’m really glad I had tried other brands before because I did think other brands were good until I tried COSRX pimple patches which are Great. Very Happy and impressed.",

I had been using the Banila Co Clean It Zero Purity cleansing balm before switching to this. I have extremely extremely oily skin & have hardly ever come across a product that manages to dry my skin out & the rare ones that did were extremely harsh soaps that I once tried to use in a misguided attempt to clear my skin by going back to my childhood cleansing practices (ah! the good old days when we could wash our faces with anything & the only other step in that routine was drying ourselves & then being done with it for the entire day, & still having beautiful perfect skin. The heck happens to our skin when we grow up?!). Basically, it was expected from them. But this was unexpected. I was shocked when the moringa cleanser dried my skin out to the point that I couldn't even run my hands across my wet face cause of the friction. My skin felt completely ripped of its oils, felt tight & had turned white from being dry. & mind you, this wasn't even after drying! My face was still dripping wet! Sure, the next steps in my routine neutralized those effects but that just defeats the whole purpose now, doesn't It? If this cleansing balm dried my skin out that much, then I don't know how even combination skin people can handle this, forget normal & dry skin! I was also sorely disappointed by how well it cleansed. You would think, with how much It was drying my skin out, that it was doing some serious heavy lifting in the cleansing department, but no. It wasn't able to remove my heavier makeup completely which the Banila Co cleanser had no problems with. You also get a lot less for the price. All in all, really not worth it. The only positive thing I can say about this is that it atleast didn't break me out. But I am going back to my Banila Co cleanser.",

At first I was a little hesitant to try the @COSTX Advanced Snail 92 All in One Cream at first, being that it's made mainly of snail slime/secretion. I've always heard that snail mucin does wonders on our skin and people who regularly use it look much younger. It doesn't have a bad smell so it was mind over matter once I rubbed this moisturizer into my face. I definitely didn't need to add other moisturizer afterwards as this stuff made my skin feel super nourished, plump and gave me a dewy glow! I'm eager to see how my skin looks after longer use of it! #snailedit",

I tried adding the toner as the first step in that routine and felt like on those days my face was oilier than it usually is. I cut it to evenings only and my skin is not oily and just happily moisturized! I have sensitive combination skin that can react quickly and badly to new skincare items or bad ingredients. No such problems with this toner, or any other Soon Jung products for that matter! it's a great line for sensitive skin and I just love the minimal and powerful ingredients they offer. And really fair prices too! I like that this toner helps calm and balance my skin after a day of wearing skincare, makeup, sunscreen, and then my evening cleansing routine. I think my skin appreciates the toner in the evenings more after it's dealt with all of that and can re-balance. Looks like one bottle will last a fairly long time as well (should be at minimum 4-5 months - although again I only use at night). Can't recommend enough!",

I asked the skin concierge to recommend a cream to help even out tone and texture while hydrating my skin and I'm so glad I listened to them and gave this a try. This sinks deeply into my skin and I actually feel like it hydrates my skin several layers deep. I've also seen an improvement in tone and texture and it works great at night and during the day under makeup. Really a little goes a long way. The key to applying this is take a small pea sized amount, warm between fingers and then smooth and press into the skin. If you apply straight to face it feels thick but when you warm up first, it melts into an almost serum like texture. Best part is the results! Cant say enough good things about this. LOVE! ",

Then I found that inspiring article on Soko blog about how this woman treated her hormonal acne with Dr Oracle and I had a BLAST! Works better than I expected!

Combining it with CorsX patches and a month later, my skin is smooth, I only have pimples here and there (hormones, amIright?) but drastically less than before, my scars are faded...

I use Shu Eumura toners and BR Lotion P50 but this beauty water caught my eye. I bought two bottles one for me and the other for my daughter who has very sensitive skin prone to dryness. With my first try of the beauty water I loved it. After double cleansing my skin I used it and felt my face looked great. i now use it after cleansing before I put on my other products. As for my daughter she uses it after the gym and after cleansing at night. She also uses it in the morning instead of a water and product cleansing and she feels her skin is not dry or irritated. She has tried many toners and one cleansing water before but was never very impressed with them. This one is something she feels works on her skin and is quick and easy to use. she also uses it after the gym and I think in the summer it will be great to use after exercising and being outdoor. I am. Ot one to write reviews but am impressed with this product.",

The oil itself it quite thick and never really melted into my skin. This made it difficult to \"gently massage in small circles,\" as the product wouldn't glide and kind of halted in place. I used it still to try and remove makeup, and it did accomplish this but at a cost. When I added water for the rinse process, the product would build up in one place, and my face never completely felt clean after using; it felt instead as if the product was still slicked over wherever it had been applied on my face and remnants of makeup were hanging around in this slick. That is, this was an oil cleanser that really required a double cleanse. The only way to get the product off was to use a really foamy follow-up cleanser. So, if you are committed to that, it isn't a problem and more or less fulfills its duty as the first step in a cleansing process. And, the bonus is it really won't irritate your skin. ",

I’ve been using it during the summer and felt like it kept my skin moisturized in the heat. I’m interested to see how it goes with winter dry months and cold/flu season when my nose and cheeks are chapped. ",

Never have I ever experienced such a significant improvement in such a short amount of time. I've used everything from Tata Harper to Lancome to La Prairie and I've never experienced such good results. The formula of this eye cream is really moisturizing and the texture is very smooth and silky. It absorbs well and sit well under makeup. I'm someone who suffers from chronic puffy under eyes and this eye cream has depuffed and smoothed my under eyes drastically. I would definitely recommend this eye cream to others as it's something I'll be repurchasing in the future. ",

But it works so well i bite the bullet and buy it. I reccomend those with very acne prone skin to use it even after the pimple has popped. I noticed pimples would still come back or i would get blackheads from popped pimples. But if i popped the pimple and then put a patch on, more gunk would come out & my pore was back to its “normal” self after. ",

I will say I don't find it *extremely * hydrating but its good enough lol and the packaging is adorable! ill probably make rose water I put it in there when it runs out. ",

   "Review": "If you have oily skin, this is your new best friend. I tried cleansing balms and sometimes felt that they were too heavy for my skin, and cleansing water doesn't get off my mascara, lash glue, and more stubborn makeup, so I was on the hunt for a good makeup remover that easily removed ev-er-y-thing without making my skin oilier or leaving it with a residue. This oil cleanser is perfect for my skin, and I save it to use for my event makeup and heavier makeup days because I know it will work! I put 2-3 pumps and rub it together in my fingers, then massage my face with it. Then I add a little bit of water and continue massaging it in to emulsify everything, and when I wash it off all the makeup is gone and my face feels clean! I of course use a second water-based cleanser to make sure everything is clean. I haven't really noticed a difference in my blackheads, but that's probably because I don't use it continuously. Long story short, if you have oily/combo skin, give this a try!",

Contrary to what I have heard about other vitamin C serums, this was not sticky/tacky (but can be if you use too much), had no smell, and did not cause any irritation (such as stinging, burning, or redness) whatsoever. It felt like nothing was on my skin. I have had this for 2 months and it has not oxidized *at all*, but I also keep it in the fridge and have the dropper open and exposed to air for less than 60 seconds when using it to make sure it does not go bad. I believe that the combination of this product every morning plus just taking good care of my skin in general over the course of 2 months has helped with that leftover redness. I don't have another one to compare it to since it's my first, but I would recommend this to anyone wanting to try vitamin C for the first time.",

However, I would say I’m a pretty medium skin toned girl (Maybelline fit me in 330) and I have never been able to find a mineral sunscreen that leaves absolutely no white/gray/purple cast on my skin until I used this. It’s a little pricey but take it from a college student who loves skincare (bad combo tbh), it is SO worth it. I also have extremely dry skin, especially above my top lip for some reason, and this spf not only moisturizes and smoothes my skin, but it also did not cling to any dry patches and make it white. I also have eczema and the skin on my face can get sensitive at times but I love the fact that this is fragrance free. I’ve used chemical sunscreens before and have favored some Korean based ones for their absence of white cast but they ended up being removed from the market and needed to find an alternative, however, the ones that are made/formulated in the US at least are very irritating. However, you don’t have to worry about any chemical filters that could irritate your skin with this since it is mineral. Overall, I LOVE this spf so much and if you have a medium/tan skin tone, you NEED to try it!",

It has a very light scent, which I like. However, I find this to be too stripping. For reference, I have slightly oily, VERY dehydrated skin. Innisfree oil cleansers have been a game changing product for me. I keep trying other brands, but I always return. The Olivarrier cleanser is certainly not the worst cleanser I've tried, but it does not feel like an oil cleanser, just a typical water-based foam. I plan to use it a few times a week but may end up giving it to a friend who has very oily skin. ",

That said, as it's a wash off cleanser, not a big deal. If anything, the tea tree likely helps acne prone skin like mine! I love the texture of the gel, super fun. Great user experience. I wouldn't recommend using this if you have dry skin as most lathering cleansers (like this one) will likely be too stripping even though it is very gentle on the skin. I have combination skin and tend to reach for this when I wake up super oily in the morning or have a thick layer of occlusive on my skin from the night before. If you're a fan of tea tree, want a fun gel cleanser, and aren't going to be stripped by a lathering cleaner, definitely give this a shot! ",

Two applications of pea-sized amounts each time and I am not greasy. However, I also find myself feeling the need to reapply more often than I would like to, as certain areas of the hands like the purlicue, knuckles, cuticles, etc. dry out and crack again often before I've washed my hands again or applied more sanitizer. I think that if it wasn't a pandemic I would likely give this hand cream 5 stars but it has the consistency of a lotion as opposed to a cream, and perhaps that is why I am burning through it so quickly and it isn't as effective or long-lasting as I would like.",

However, it turns out the sunflower seed oil in the product is causing fungal acne (malassezia folliculitis) to appear on my forehead and jaw/neck area. I was using a balm before and a gel for my acne which was doing relatively well. Soon after I switched to the oil cleanser the tiny bumps came back and now I’m having a hard time getting rid of them again. Really wish I’d know about this before repurchasing. Other than that I’d recommend to anyone who doesn’t suffer from fungal acne. ",

Both balms are great but this one has a slightly more strong/fragrant smell but not in a bad way. It breaks down and \"melts\" really easily and makes my skin feeling super clean after. It is cleaning and gentle on my skin. I do like this cleansing balm better because I noticed that my skin looks noticeably less red and irritated! I think I'll stick with this cleansing balm [over Banila co] because I see an improvement with my skin. ",

I used these on three different parts of my face on three pimples during their various stages of development. For the first one, it made the pimple come to a head the next day and I was able to pop it with ease and then put a different patch on the spot. For the other two, I saw a tiny bit of shrinkage, but they remain just as red as always. For a package of six, I don't want to use more than one per spot. I don' think I will be purchasing these again. ",

The formula is completely different from anything else I’ve tried, It has a slimy consistency but as soon as its applied to the skin it soaks up nicely without a sticky or heavy residue. Its very lightweight and hydrating. I find that it has really helped with my uneven skin tone and smile lines. My makeup doesn’t crease as much in that area and without makeup my complexion looks more even and much brighter. I really enjoyed incorporating this product in my skincare routine I feel like it has made quite the significance in my overall skin appearance. Definitely recommend!

I have sensitive skin so ingredients are important to me and I have not had any breakouts from this product after using it for 3 months now.

They seem to pull whatever gunk is in my pimples as there is a lot of white stuff on the patch the next morning. The patches after using them seem to make my pimple less noticeable as well. They seem to work the same way as other brands I’ve tried. The adhesive does really stick to your skin. I haven’t tried to wear them over/under makeup, as I don’t really wear makeup these days. But they are discreet even on makeup free skin. So for a pimple patch, these work well, but I wouldn’t say they are anything special. ",

The texture definitely reminds me of snail secretion, stringy and slimy. It takes a certain technique to get it out of the jar without it stringing down your arm, the same technique does not work when you're moving from one side of your face to the other. There were so many times this ended up on my lips. Aside from the ick factor I didn't find this did anything it claims to do. I used it twice daily for one month before writing this review. This made my skin feel dry and made my skin tone look more uneven. I saw no improvement in fine lines or wrinkles and did not have more of a natural glow. I would not recommend this product. ",

I was always hesitant to use the double cleansing method just because it hadn't worked with my skin in the past but I took a chance on this product and I'm so glad I did. Starting with clean hands I take a small maybe dime sized scoop and rub this all over my face and neck. Its like a balm at first but the more you rub it together it turns into an oil. This product does NOT dry me out either. Double cleansing with a foam does. So if you have normal to dry skin I recommend trying out an oil. Another plus with this product is that I never realized how much makeup was still left over even after just wipes and cleansing. This + my cleansing cream removes everything. I'm so glad I've added this to my skin care routine. I see and feel the difference. If you're hesitant to buy this product I definitely recommend just trying it out. For how much product you're getting and how long it will last you its definitely worth the price!",

After 3 days my skin was no longer red and puffy. Any scabs had formed, dried up, and peeled off in this amount of time, which is extremely fast healing considering I looked like I smacked into concrete at 25mph.

Charlotte does an excellent job explaining the concept of Jeong. She opens up about her personal experiences with it and gives tips on how to develop it daily through “small acts of Jeong.” After reading this book I called friends I had not talked to in a long time and try to have a real, meaningful conversion. I have lunch scheduled with a couple more that are closer to my location, and am determined to create more deep and meaningful connections. I can’t help but think again and again about her final reflection: “with time being so finite, it’s rarely the titles that we chase, the number of followers we have, or fancy things we own that bring us joy, but our long-lasting memories and relationships with people and places that matter most.” ",

The consistency is like gelatin which I wasn’t expecting, so you do need the scoop they send to get it out of the container. It has a fresh scent so if scents bother you, you may want to pass on it. Overall it’s ok, but I do not think I would repurchase it once it is gone. ",

I don't like the feeling of wearing makeup and this feels fairly light. It's very easy to blend and even though it comes out looking a little gray the color changes to match my skin after application. I have dark brown hair, blue eyes and fairly light skin tone in the winter, but I tan very quickly in the summer. #23 works great during the winter months but is a little too pale for the summer. I'm going to try #27 next for the warmer months. I love that it lasts all day and doesn't settle into fine lines!

I'm very satisfied that Live Tinted thought about mineral sunscreen for deeper skin tones because we tend to be an afterthought in the beauty industry at-large. I've tried other mineral sunscreens, and they either leave a white cast or they add a weird residue to my skin if it doesn't leave a white cast. Hueguard doesn't leave a white cast AND it doesn't leave a weird residue/film on my skin. This is a great product and I'm very happy with my purchase. I will be re-purchasing in the future!",

There is also a cast, which does eventually settle into the skin but if you’re a get ready quick kinda person, you’ll definitely need to give yourself more of a time buffer to let the cast disappear. I guess a good thing would be that this sunscreen makes me put it on 15 minutes before I go out in the sun since it takes that long for the white cast to disappear. On the plus side, there is no weird smell and the applicator is very user friendly.",

I was previously using wipes to take off my makeup and then washing my face multiple times to get it all off and there would still be eye makeup left after all my efforts. Now I massage this oil on my face for 30secs, spend an additionally 30secs massaging my eye area and just like that usually in 1 go - all my makeup is gone. I first tried this with only sunscreen on and it was amazing to see the white of the sunscreen just melt off when it emulsifies. When I wash it off, it doesn't feel greasy and my skin feels moisturized - I double cleanse with a regular foam cleanser after and man, I'm never going back. My skin loves it.",

They're also very adherent and a good size in order to cover the biggest pimples' surfaces. I have not found something that works better than these though, particularly at this price point.

It seems to help control my hormonal acne and if I do get a pimple it does not get as inflamed and does not last long. I don't even feel the need to bother with concealer anymore.

I’ve tried everything I could think of for skin care, drugstore and high end products, and products made for sensitive skin. Every one of them caused very bad allergic reactions and hot, flushed burning pain. Even using plain aloe very gently would cause painful burning. It would take many days for my skin to stop burning and red hot flushing to subside just a little. One day, I came across the Soon Jung brand and tried the intensive cream. This is the first product that does not cause burning and allergic reactions. I got it last Dec and my skin has improved and calmed down so much. Applying the cream does not burn or cause flushing and pain. I love it! I definitely recommend it, especially if you have sensitive skin that is allergy prone to external and internal triggers. My favorite products are the Intensive Cream, Emulsion, Cica balm, and toner. I choose which moisturizer to use based on dryness and temperature of my skin. I will choose toner and then Emulsion for a warmer day, or choose all at once in the order of toner, Emulsion, cream, and balm if it is colder or my skin is having a bad day. Highly recommended! ",

Because I have read of its healing abilities, I also generously apply more on acne scars and it works wonders. Absolute must have. ",

My skin burned when I applied my usual products. Nothing I had was doing the trick so I decided to switch back to this toner and I immediately noticed results. My skin felt smooth and moisturized and it even soothed some small blemishes I was developing. So happy I kept this one around! My skin is finally comfortable again.

However, I do love the lightweight gel/light cream texture to the product. It has been perfect for summer and a little goes a long way. One bottle has lasted me a good couple of months with daily use morning and night. I haven't noticed much of a fragrance but beware getting too close to your eyes with this product.

So it absorbs really quickly and you’re ready for the next layer of your skin care. Also, I DO NOT RECCOMEND YOU USE ON ACNE. It says in the description, but I didn’t see that... so just be careful if you have acne or have acne prone skin. It’ll make those blemishes more juicy. I DO see a decent decrease in redness in my cheeks over time and the serum doesn’t irritate me at all, except on my acne prone nose. ",

As long as there is a visible, near-surface head or you use them on a pimple that has just been popped these patches will pull up all that gunk. I even had a deep pimple, waited for a head, popped it, and slapped a patch over it, and I was shocked by the amount of gunk that it pulled up and how quickly it had reduced the inflammation. They are also so nearly invisible that I've told my mom it was on my face and asked her to point it out and she wasn't able to! Sometimes I even forget they're on 😂 Couldn't be happier, Ill be buying these forever! ",

Vitamin C is quite an unstable product, which is why as a powder it lasts a bit longer than as a serum. Usually Vitamin C is expensive because of the difficulty to formulate. This powder by Neogen is good in the sense that it is a reasonable price, and I don't feel like I need to rush to finish the product because of the fear of oxidation. I don't think its a bad product at all, but I do not like having to mix it every morning. It's just not as convenient as using a serum. Especially as a student, I'm often tired or rushed in the morning, and this product takes longer to apply and can be messy. It was a good product to try, and I think its a good Vitamin C, but I probably will not repurchase the product because I don't want to have to deal with attempting to get the right ratios each morning.

The only other oil I have is Nature Republic Argon Hair Oil and that one doesn't feel was nourishing as this one. I randomly came across this on Costco's website and it was for half the price! After washing and drying my hair, I apply a pump of oil on my palm and rub my hands together. Starting from the ends of my hair I'll lightly work my way up, but never getting close enough to the roots because that will make my scalp feel greasy. The fragrance is also amazing and light. ",

She enjoys how lightweight the formula is and that it doesn’t leave an icky white residue like most other sunscreens. I make sure that she applies the recommended layers before leaving the house and she looks better than ever. I’m extremely happy with my purchase from Live Tinted. ",

It's only been a bit over a week since I started using it, so I cannot say whether it is effective. I can only say that there are no overnight results. I got a bit of milia in my upper eye, but it went away after a couple of days. The texture is a bit thick and it takes a bit of time to absorb, but it's personally not too bothersome. I will continue applying it. ",

For the two months of using this product, I was getting really strange clogged pores and some cystic breakouts because of it. I didn't really realize it was this Klairs toner at first, then after a while I was skeptical of this product, but continued its use hoping my skin would clear up with further use. It didn't. I finally decided to cut this item out of my routine and my skin showed healing signed within a few days off of this product. I'm super disappointed that I spent money on this and have so much of it left, but can't use it. ",

I guess I just wanted to see for myself if I could notice a difference. Well, after a couple of weeks the two patches where I applied the cream are softer and smoother than the controls, if just by a bit. On my face, it does feel nice and moisturizing. I use a smallish dollop both morning and night, and it seems to absorb pretty quickly without leaving me greasy looking, but then again my skin's always thirsty so YMMV. My only complaint is smell, it has a fairly strong, if unoffensive smell, a bit like soap. I may buy this again, but if I don't I will definitely try another snail moisturizer! ",

The scent matches this brand's bubble cleanser, it's a fresh, natural watermelon-like scent that I really love. It's not too strong though and doesn't last, for those who are sensitive to smells. I use this mostly at night unless my skin is feeling really dry since it's a little heavy for day-time use for me. Between this and the mushroom essence, my skin is really happy and glowy! I can see the difference after less than a week and I would absolutely recommend it. Also nice that it comes with a little scoop so you don't have to dip your fingers in the jar. ",

Also, my hair is very fine and high porosity. The ends of my hair before would look so dry and frizzy within 2-3 days of washing. Using the acv shampoo and treatment fixed all of my issues. After the first use my hair retained it's softness and moisture for days without feeling weighed down and the frizz is gone! It kind of mimicks the effects of a Brazilian blowout without loosening my curl pattern. With this, I don't use any other products in my hair aside from a light oil to protect my ends and add shine. People with lower porosity hair may have different needs so I recommend researching your hair type to see if this product will work for you but if you're like me and looking to balance your hair and simplify your routine then I recommend this brand.",

About half a pump is the perfect amount for both eyes (under and lids). The gel texture is soothing and absorbs well. Too soon to tell if it’s improved the area around my eyes, but I can confidently say the skin is hydrated. No adverse reactions, no rash. And based on my experience with this, I certainly want to try their other products in this line. ",

Currently I pair it with a gel cleanser, which I've found to be the most effective method for reducing my pimples and oiliness. My skin is left hydrated and clean after using the toner, and I've watched acne scars disappear over time. I use this toner in my night routine, after my shower, as using it twice a day caused my skin to dry out a bit.

I definitely noticed the dark circles around my eyes are not as dark, and my puffiness does get better. It’s definitely moisturizing for my ultra dry skin and it’s just generally really nice to put on. I can’t speak to any burning since I’m careful not to get it into my eyes but it doesn’t bother me in any way. I love the applicator- it lets me squeeze out exactly how much I want and it’s a fair amount for how much you get. Will definitely be repurchasing! ",

It came in a very sturdy and pretty holiday box (perfect for gift giving). However, the essence was NOTHING like I hoped for and expected. It was very runny/watery which is fine but when I applied it, it felt kinda sticky and as if it left a film. It didn’t sink into the skin as well as some other watery essences like the neogen one. What was worse was the cleanser. I’m glad the gift came with a trial size because It was awful for me! First of all the “mintiness” burns my eyes, it doesn’t foam up well, and it leaves almost a waxy film after you rinse it off. The products in this set didn’t work for me but if it works for you or a friend, this is a great value and makes an easy no wrap gift.",

The positives are the packaging/ease of use and the scent, which is a nice lemon scent. On the negative side: this cleansing oil is incredibly thick and difficult to spread around my face. It doesn't emulsify, AT ALL, no matter how much water I use and how much I rub my hands in circular motions on my cheeks... It's also useless at removing eye makeup and, as per the Soko Q&A responses, shouldn't be used to remove eye makeup to begin with. This is a huge dealbreaker for me, considering oil cleansers should be able to remove any and all makeup. My skin doesn't feel fully cleansed after using this product. I've since moved back to balm. cleansers and now this product is sitting in my cabinet, more than 3/4 full - I can't even bring myself to finish it because it's just not good for my skin. Sad. :(",

I do this before I hop in the shower. By the time I'm done, the powder would be 99% dissolved in the essence and I'm able to apply without feeling the graininess against my skin. I feel like putting the essence & powder in the palm of my hand; doesn't do the trick. Like I said at the beginning, I haven't seen any difference in my skin yet.

After putting it on, I started feeling a slight burning sensation but I thought it might have been because I put it in the fridge beforehand. I ignored it and kept it on for the full 20 minutes and after removing it my skin looked greasy, not dewy. I used up the extra essence from the pouch on my neck, hands and arms. The next morning I had little red bumps and irritation all over my neck and some on my face. The following day is when it got worse on my face - it was red, bumpy, itchy and dry and I had breakouts on my entire face except around my mouth and eyes where the cut outs of the mask were. I don't know which ingredient caused this reaction but I know it was the mask because it was the only new thing in my routine. It's the worst reaction I've ever had to a skincare product and it took almost 2 weeks for my skin to recover.",

By the end, my skin would feel raw. I also agree that this does not emulsify well compared to other cleansing oils I have tried.

However, when I received it, the color was wayyyy lighter than in the description and almost looked nothing like the swatch. BTW, I got the darkest color ( I am a medium dark skinned African American women). I decided to give it a try and yes, the color was about 1 to 2 shades lighter. I kinda freaked out but then waited a couple of minutes and it kinda just blended into my skin to almost color match. Maybe it oxidized and that's why it almost work?! IDK but the texture is amazing and makes the skin look like a literal IG filter. IF I could get my exact color I would only wear this instead of ANY foundation! I really hope they can get the darker skin girls some love with more color options because this is actually an amazing product.",

In general, my small sebum bumps around my cheeks and forehead are much smaller and smoother. I have tried many serums and product combinations, and I think I have finally found the combination that works for my skin. That definitely includes this serum! My skin is sensitive, and tends to breakout from harsher chemical products and abrasive scrubs I think from damage and micro tears (?). And moisture balance has been really tough to accomplish. But so far with my newly discovered routine it has been so much better. This serum gives a soft, hydrated feeling to my skin. It is not heavy or tacky, and just leaves my skin feeling supple and smooth. My skin also looks brighter. (Although I do use other products that I think help with this also but I have seen drastic changes by using all of them together!) I highly recommend this serum if you have sensitive skin, and are looking to combat acne, hyperpigmentation, moisture balance, and redness. I gave it 4 stars only because I don’t think my results are just from this serum, but rather a combination of all the products I use together, but it absolutely maximizes the effects! I think the products really work well together and all contribute to my improved skin!",

I feel like this is the first product I've tried that doesn't make me feel like I have to choose between soothing and lightweight (and doesn't cost a fortune). I like the cooling sensation it gives my skin whenever I apply it, and it absorbs quickly. If you live in a really dry climate or have dry skin, this may not do enough for you on its own. Those with oily skin and or who are looking for a good moisturizer for humid summer months really should give this a try! ",

My moderate cystic acne that I had been clearing up with some Nature Republic products became severe. I thought that my skin was \"purging\" and kept using it, which was a mistake! I ended up having to go to my doctor to get an authorization for a dermatology appointment. After being on doxycycline pills and phosphate gel for three months, my skin became a bit better.

I started to notice around the itchy parts, a few minutes later a small bump would appear. I’m pretty sure it’s breaking me out because of the fragrance. It’s so strong. PLEASE MAKE THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT FRAGANCE. I should’ve stopped using the first time I tried it but I kept wanting to give to give it another shot. That being said, IF YOUR FACE STARTS TO ITCH AFTER TRYING A NEW PRODUCT WASH YOUR FACE IMMEDIATELY AND NEVER USE AGAIN. What a bummer. ",

After 2-3 months of scouring and trying a half dozen products to treat my new dry patches (after starting a dehydrating medication and living in an already bone dry, cold climate), I was about ready to give up when I bought this and the \"MISSHA Near Skin Simple Therapy Essence Lotion.\" I was really hesitant because of the price, but it has such good reviews and I was desperate in my search. I added this into my routine first and definitely noticed a difference immediately. Paired with the Essence Lotion (beginning a few days later), my dry patches felt normal the next morning and have stayed moisturized since (with consistent use, of course). I do kind of wish it came in a pump instead of the weird top (same as Beauty Water, with the little hole), but with how good it is, I'll accept any format.",

This one however keeps my dead skin at bay without burning or irritation and instead of drying my skin out, it feels somewhat moisturizing. Upon first application, you may feel it’s not doing anything but I found this to be a great product to incorporate into my regular skincare routine. 1-2 times a week helps smooth out my skin texture and helps all my other products work better.",

I will never worry about this irritating my skin and it never did. Honestly, this product deserves a 10/10. It's not a star in the skincare routine but it does its job as a supporting role very nicely and makes your skin feel very comfortable.

I tried keeping my skin ultra-hydrated with thick moisturizers and using sunscreen and that's also been hleping my acne. The real test was when I went on vacation this past week. I decided to leave my mugwort essence at home bc I didn't want to go through the hassle of moving it to a carry-on travel size container and I regret that decision. My skincare routine stayed the same, minus the essence. my diet was the same. I doubt one slice of pizza caused the massive breakout all over my face. Chin, forehead, cheeks, nose, under my jaw. Just whiteheads, but the missing essence was the only thing that could've been the cause. I'm ordering a new bottle today. This, and weak retinol products from the inkey list, were the only active skincare products that i use and I hadn't used the retinol a few weeks prior to vacation (i knew I'd be exposed to a lot of sun). My Cereve cleanser and nivea moisturizer only maintain the skin condition, not fix it. Highly recommend this product, though i'm always up for trying something new. But this one's on my list of products I can swear by. ",

It still felt grainy when I applied it to my skin (I am not a fan of grainy textures because I’m afraid they will be abrasive on my redness-prone skin). My skin also pulled a bit after patting it on. I wonder if I should mix it with a cream instead? I will keep trying, because I have always had good experiences with vitamin C products, but I must admit that this trial and error approach does not make it super convenient. It’s nice to have vitamin C in a shelf stable formula, but so far it feels a bit complicated especially as I run to go through my routine in the morning. ",

I heard it was amazing and just went with it with having no thoughts of opinions on what it could possibly do. For starters, this thing has cured my oily skin. I had been suffering with a really oily forehead and this cured me. It's almost as if my skin stopped overproducing oil now that I have this on. Other then that, its incredibly moisturizing and although it might have the slightest oil feeling when you put it on, it soaks in your skin completely and does not leave you with your skin feeling oily, or tacky or anything. I think this has helped with my acne as well because of the oil problem as well as forehead wrinkles. As for my cheeks which I have rosacea on; its soft now as it used to be rough spots and more red. HOWEVER, I have been using another Klairs Blue Calming Cream on that area specifically so that could have just been that. But Klairs products are amazing. And if I could only take one skin care product with me on a deserted island, it would be this. It doesn't smell, it certainly doesn't smell like oranges so if you're sensitive to scents dont worry about it. It also feels so cool applying it I feel bougie with the dropper. 11/10",

I was looking for something a little heavier because I'm older and I needed something more moisturizing for winter. I also did not like the mild citrus scent since I usually prefer unscented products. I am pleased to say this moisturizer is great - even though the texture is light, it is very hydrating and it definitely makes my skin softer and look brighter. The mild scent fades quickly, so that's a non-issue for me now. Definitely will repurchase. ",

So there is a weird period where I felt oily and started to break out the first two weeks. It's been over a month and my skin has adapted to all the hydration. Honestly, it takes quite a bit of time to adjust but it makes me feel taken care of. Even if I don't use all the products all the time, I'm actually really happy with this kit. It feels like much needed self care when I do the whole set. When it's time to listen to history documentaries and do my skin care routine, I can relax and just enjoy. It's helpful, especially with being stuck inside during Covid-19. It makes me take care of myself when I feel icky and depressed.",

   "Review": " This essence has been the biggest let down for me of any skincare I have purchased in a very, very long time. I was on the wait-list and was so excited when I was finally notified that it was back in stock. Did not open the bottle right away as I was still finishing up some Missha essence that I had. I am about half way done with this bottle now and have realized that it not only has not done anything to contribute to the promised \"honey skin\" look, but it is also the cause of some recent tight, itchy feeling that I have been having along my jawline. Luckily, my other purchases from Soko Glam have been stellar, amazing products and I have also found another essence that I am now using that helped get rid of that itchy feeling and leaves my skin looking like it glows from within. I suppose I will throw the rest of this essence in the trash :( ",

   "Review": " I had stocked up on this because I originally loved it at first, but now I kind of regret doing that. I have enjoyed the fact that I can just toss one in my gym bag, which makes it super convenient and easy to travel with. I also do love how well this cleanses, but it does sometimes leave me looking a little red, especially since some of the green tea pieces in it are a little sharp. I do believe this could also be the cause of a lot of break outs I have been having, as they just have not been going away. I had thought that maybe the redness and breakouts might have been from some of my other products that have been in my routine for a while, but it has just been constant break outs. I was denying the thought of it maybe being this because it was giving me the feel of a deep cleanse. It's probably time to ditch using this product :-( ",

I'm hoping this was just an issue with the tube I received and that the future tubes will hold together. Aside from that this moisturizer really is the best I've used. ",

But this is gentle enough to use in the morning for fresh skin throughout the day and week. The two-sided pad makes it really easy to use. The smell is lovely and refreshing. I definitely notice a difference! Highly recommended. ",

The old moisturizer i was using changed their ingredients and added a scent that caused my skin to get irritated, so i decided to try this. It is not irritating at all. It has no fragrance, which is a plus for me. It gives your skin a natural feeling. Sometimes if i have really dry spots on my cheeks from the mandatory face coverings, i will apply another layer just in those areas to help. I think i will definitely buy this again. ",

I am not sure if the white cast is intentional (some Korean brands intentionally add them for a \"tone-up\" effect) and while I am not against the white cast, this sunscreen will not work for anyone darker than very fair.

I have not had that experience at all. My face also doesn't air dry and I end up putting products on my skin while it is just about to be dry but not dry. After the first was my skin was so smooth like a baby's bum and it has been that way since. My hyperpigmentation has also started to clear up a bit and it's only been a week and a half since I've been using it, and this is the only thing that has changed about my routine. Even though it lathers it's so gently. I highly recommend this product! ",

   "Review": "BEWARE PEOPLE WITH POLLEN/DUST MITE ALLERGIES!! I had NO idea that there was a link between people having severe snail mucin reactions and having existing allergies to dust mites and pollen. I ran out of my hyaluronic acid serum and wanted a product to keep my dry skin hydrated until my serum came in the mail. I heard rave reviews on snail mucin over the years but never actually tried it until now, seeing that it included hyaluronic acid I was excited to try it. I used this product day and night for a total of 4 days. For the first 2 days I noticed tiny little red patches forming on the apples of my cheeks but my skin is always a bit red in those areas, regardless, so I kind of just wrote it off. I have been battling to try to fill in this one deeper fine line on my forehead for the last 10 months and I was soooo happy that within 2 days, I saw VISIBLE reduction of that fine line while using this snail serum. I was ecstatic!! The 4th morning I woke up and noticed my face looked a bit weird. My skin's texture was almost... bumpy? Which it has NEVER been. The redness had spread further on my cheeks, nose and chin. My face never ever has looked like this before I had no idea what happened to it. I went about my morning skin routine (again applying the cosrx snail mucin after my toner) and my face EXPLODED. Almost immediately my face got really really hot, the redness spread around my entire face and I looked like a firetruck, big blotches popped up on my skin and it burned the whole day long and even into the next morning. My skin has never reacted to any product in this manner before, leading me to do some online research where I found several other reviews of people who had allergic reactions to this product and ALSO (oddly enough) had dust mite/pollen allergies as well (which I do have). I have immediately stopped using this product, it's been 2 days since I've last used it and my face is still red and itchy/blotchy. I wish SokoGlam had put a warning in their description for anyone with these preexisting allergies (pollen/dust mites) that there is a potential link to snail secretion allergic reactions, I hope my face stops burning soon",

It's been over 3 weeks of using this and any small pimples around my forehead, chin, and nose has gone smooth. I used to use blotting papers pretty regularly but now I haven't touched them in about 2 weeks. It isn't overly drying even when I used it on a dry face day too. I would recommend this product to anyone dealing with acne or oiliness. I also will be repurchasing when I run out but that won't be for a while I think!",

I definitely feel clean after using it, even though I do still follow up with a water based cleanser.

Whenever I see a white head about to form, I'll slap one on and the patch will speed up the healing process. I've also applied the patch to other types of blemishes -- ingrown hairs, rosacea bumps, etc. -- and they do a great job of keeping the area protected, off my mind, and seems to heal the site faster. I also like how this patch camouflages the blemish. I have pale skin so a deep red dot is extremely noticeable; this patch blends nicely with my skin and you can easily miss noticing the patch altogether. The patch does a good job sapping out oils and impurities from the site itself and reducing the size and redness of the blemish. I'd like a version of this patch with a few more active ingredients -- like salicylic acid, for example -- but the fact that those ingredients aren't in these patches means they can apply to a wider range of blemish types. I tried applying a bit of concealer on top and around the patch to make it even less noticeable, but I wouldn't rely on this method; makeup got underneath the patch, you can still see the ridges, and it wasn't an ideal experience (a lighter application of makeup might work for you). Overall a really nice product! ",

   "Review": " I started using this serum around two months ago to help manage my rosacea. While using it I had no major flare ups. I couldn't tell if this was due to the serum or other products, so I stopped using it to see how effective it was. When I stopped using it for a week I had an intense flare up with some pustules. When I started using this serum again, everything calmed down. Needless to say this is a holy grail staple product for me! I love that it has two different forms of licorice root, niacinamide, AND is totally fragrance free/essential oil free. I've used this with other hydrating serums and it worked great, but now I prefer using it on it's own to really let the ingredients do their thing. I've used it morning and night when my skin is feeling a little more sensitive. When it's more under control, I just use it in the morning and other serums at night. Either way has been really effective for my sensitive skin. ",

THIS fulfills that with the 7 types of hyaluronic acid it contains alongside its other complex but advantageous ingredients. So far the only essences I've truly loved and continue to love are Rovectin's essence lotion & Neogen's Micro Essence. Both are amazing. Results are visible and my skins looooves them.

I don't have a lot of acne as an adult, but these are so handy for the occasional pimple I do get and helps them to go on their way much faster than before. ",

This essence s the bomb given its inclusion of several fermented ingredients, and it's no surprise to me that my acne is clearing up as a result of using this essence. It's gentle, feels great on the skin, absorbs quickly and pairs well with its serum cohort that also contains fermented ingredients. I have a feeling that this is going to stay in my skin care routine long term, and is going to help my skin stay healthy and glowy! ",

I have dry skin and usually need a thick cream at night so this didn't quite work for me. I applied a layer and it got absorbed quickly, but my skin felt taut so I applied another layer. I repeated this 2 more times and gave up. I found that using a layer of this and putting on Egyptian Magic on top works well. Using the oily Egyptian Magic alone doesn't feel moisturizing to me so I'm thinking maybe the Collagen Lifting Cream has high water content but not much oil. Hence, I'm guessing this would work better for someone with an oily skin.",

I have a combination skin type; my natural skin is oily, but some areas of my face is peeling due to Retin-A. This is the oily moisturizer that hydrates my sensitive skin without causing any further inflammations to the existing acne. I've been using this moisturizer for 3 months now and i find myself reaching for this tube whenever my skin needs help. I also realize that it helps heal my popped pimples a lot quicker. An additional bonus point for this product is that it leaves your skin matte after application so it's perfect for those oily skin peeps out there! IF, you have SUPER DRY skin then i won't recommend using this.",

Well worth the price (and a little goes a long way!). ",

If I use it as a normal serum, my skin does not absorb it completely (oily skin), and I can spend half a day with the product still on my skin. If I mix it with my moisturizer or use it as a spot treatment, the result is spectacular. It has helped a lot with the pigmentation of my acne (one-week results). I have a lot of appreciation for propolis because it is used in gauze for burns or deep wounds and is excellent. I don't give it 5 stars just because it takes time to absorb it.

The day cream is thicker than the night cream, but I did find it absorb a lot faster than others I have tried. I feel an oily film on my face when I wear other creams. As for the night cream, there is a vague lavender scent. I am not a huge fan of lavender, but the scent is really not noticeable. I have been using the advice to layer the creams. And I love the effect. I live in California so I definitely do not recommend only putting one layer of this cream during the winter in the colder regions. I trust Joan Kim with her lotion selections especially since she has been living in Korea- the coldest and driest winters. I am a fan of Joan Kim, but because of this I judged the cream at a greater disadvantage point. I really can't believe the effects of the cream. I woke up to glowly skin. The effect really reminds me of the Cosrx Nourishing Rice Sleeping Mask. Another great product that I have gotten advice from Joan Kim. I can only imagine that she was inspired by that sleeping mask. In conclusion, great creams and worth the price. ",

I have reactive skin, I'm not sure if it's the small physical exfoliants in it but this other wise would have been the dream cleanser as the consistency and texture are both beautiful! I will have to evidently gift it as I know it doesn't work on my skin! Anyone else have a similar reaction or would recommend something else to try? ",

I was apprehensive because I've been using the same micellar water to remove my make up for years, but I was intrigued by the concept and all the good reviews. I have combination skin that has been pretty dry recently, and I'm prone to hormonal breakouts. The first few days I used this, my skin was super soft, even, and felt great. It does NOT remove eye make up as easily as I expected. I only use mascara and sometimes light eye shadow. I've tried applying and then rinsing off, wiping it off while dry, and wiping it off while wet, and repeating the entire process, and it still leaves traces of mascara on my eyelids. I really had to rub my eyes to get it off, which is obviously what you want to avoid. It also seems that after two weeks of using it, I've started to breakout (non hormonal) and I have not changed anything else in my skin care routine. I am curious as to how long other reviewers have been using this. ",

I noticed that a lot of people saw results from this product almost immediately after they put it on, but it did not take me until a week to notice that my skin was getting the results the product was supposed to give. For me, it was not a big deal that it did not give me immediate results, its just some of the reviews threw me off and made me expect quick results when it really depends on the condition of your skin and you skincare routine. So great product! Makes your skin feel hydrated and look brighter, but not the best smelling (as to be expected from the fermented yeast). ",

I don’t even have to use it that often. Once a week. MAYBE twice a week. There are 30 pads, and I still have not run out yet.

The problem is, if you rub it over your skin even two or three times... it begins to become sudsy on your face, and leaves behind a slick residue. Even if you're very light handed with it, it still leaves behind a kind of sticky coating of some kind. It almost feels too heavy for my face somehow? And makes it more difficult for everything else to absorb into the skin, rather causing them to 'sit' on top of this product and turn more greasy. It might be good for really dry skin that needs that extra layer of moisture. I've tried my regiment with and without this toner, and without it my skin drinks up the other products. With it, everything seems to build into layers, leaving my skin more tacky and 'wet' for longer. But my least favorite aspect is definitely how it becomes soapy on the skin after a bit of rubbing. ",

   "Review": "I have sensitive skin that leans towards dry. I have tried 4-5 Vitamin C serums and this was my least favorite of all the ones I have purchased from Soko Glam. I purchased this for my mom after reading the reviews and she complained she didn't notice a difference. So then I took the serum from her and gave it a try. I did not like the consistency it was almost gel like but thick honey like - so difficult to spread and does not glide easily on the skin. I also did not notice a difference on my skin in terms of hydration or fading of any spots. The bottle dropper also makes it difficult to get out any extra liquid at the bottom of the jar - so you end up wasting parts of the liquid that you cannot retrieve easily from the dropper. Only gave 2 stars because it is gentle on the skin, no side effects, but then again no benefits either.",

   "Review": " Coming from someone who is a huge fan of the green tea toner from this brand, I had pretty high hopes. It’s a decent product — it definitely does provide hydration/moisture and is light enough for me to apply other products afterward without leaving an icky, sticky feeling. My skin has become increasingly dry and dehydrated over the past few years, so I appreciate a simple step like this to boost my moisture levels. BUT I wouldn’t look to it as a “fix” or miracle product, you’ll definitely need additional products if you have dehydrated skin like me. Overall still a great purchase, especially at its price point!

I read on here that someone else tried using it as a toner, and it performed much better as a toner for me! My skin felt purified, and my acne shrunk after using it as a toner. I might buy it as an extra toner for those breakout days! ",

I admit I do not have a lot but it does not hurt to start using anti wrinkle products. It also helps to hydrate my skin, especially my cheeks because they can get flaky-dry. At first, I mixed it with my lotion as the last step, although this still works, I found out that it works best for me when using it in place of the serum step. I feel that my skin benefits more. I will admit that the bottle can go fast when it is used day and night (which I do), but it does last at least a month or so. Just wanted to note that because I frequently do use it and the size of the bottle is smaller (which other reviewers have mentioned). I have repurchased this product and will continue to do so because my skin always looks great afterwards! ",

This moisturizer was non-irritating and didn’t cause any breakouts. I wore this on top of a heavier moisturizer that typically use, prior to applying my makeup. It was almost like a gel-like skin serum primer. I have to say, it left my skin GLOWING! I was pretty surprised by how great it worked and how good my skin looked. Supple, tight, and bright. I would definitely recommend this product. I’m so glad I received this complimentary gift from Influenster and was given a chance to try it.",

I had not heard of Cos RX before but I definitely love pimple patches and was excited to try them! The first time I tried a few of the patches, the next morning I woke up and it didn’t pull anything out of my skin. Sometimes this does happen with pimple patches but I used about seven and didn’t get results on any of them. I waited a couple days to try a couple more patches and I used about three and I used two from a different pimple patch brand to see the difference the next morning. Only one of the Cos RX patches pulled anything and it was a very little amount compared to the other pimple patches that I love that pulled a lot of gunk out of my skin. I continue to try a couple more patches a couple days afterwards and I really wasn’t impressed by them at all. The other brand that I compared to is Ollie Belle and the major difference that I see is that Ollie Belle’s patches are curved and I think it holds more gunk while Cos RX patches are completely flat so if it pulls any gunk, it doesn’t go anywhere it just like sits in your skin. In my photo, I circled the three Cos RX patches in red that I put on one night and you can see the difference to the two that aren’t circled on the top in which are Ollie Belle patches. You can see they did not pull as much gunk out as Ollie Belle. Overall, I would not buy Cos RX pimple patches and I would not recommend them. ",

It doesn't suction properly unless you squeeze the dropper very slowly to allow suction to build up. So perhaps the applicator can be improved. If you have oily skin, I would say it's good only for the winter. It's quite thick and rich, so I can see how oily skinned people may not enjoy it in warmer temperatures. ",

I noticed that my skin started to glow and look hydrated (even before I layer my essence on) which makes me feel like my skin is actually resurfacing. My mom (who I FaceTime often and who always has something to say about my appearance) even complimented my skin the other day (!!!) which was just confirmation that this product works for me. While the maskne isn't completely gone, it has calmed down and my skin looks vibrant, not dull. I'm definitely keeping this oil while I figure the right routine.",

Using regular conditioner near my roots makes my hair feel heavy and greasy, but this stuff soaks right in and I can go days without having to wash it. I use it with the La'Dor Scalp Treatment. After two washes, my scalp is no longer dry and the tiny annoying flakes are 99% gone. Right now I'm using a Jason brand shampoo for scalp problems, but when the bottle is finished, I think I am going to try the La'Dor shampoo.",

This Korean step system is so gentle and effective for my skin. I have eczema and didn't realize my face was so dry and flaky in some areas. After using this for about 1 month, I can say my face doesn't feel inflamed from the products, my face is hydrated, and looks more healthy. Its worth it! The products are gentle for my sensitive prone skin. And my pores and acne scars are less visible, which I really appreciate the most.",

At first, I tried to use a smaller size in case the patched dried up my skin around the blemish but that did not happen at all! These did not dry the skin around the blemish out at all. It was incredibly satisfying. I would highly recommend this product to a friend because the results were excellent. I will be back to repurchase this product! ",

This was recommended by a soko glam team member during a skin concierge conversation so i decided to give it a go. It is just perfect! I’d compare it to be like a mix between skinRx lab’s made cera cream and for anyone that’s familiar, Freck. beauty’s RICH B*TCH moisturizer. It’s thick and dewy but not overly so where I can comfortably wear it during the day without looking greasy, just wonderfully dewy. It may be a bit too much for those with oily skin, or combo skin in the summer time, but personally im very pleased with this for the winter months at least. ",

Adding so much tea tree is such a bonus for me too as I'm immunocompromised and keep it in the house to add to practically everything anyway. Also the astringent properties of the Willow Bark is great for my pores on my nose and forehead, yet It isn't drying for my skin, and doesn't make me peel.

I've been using this for about a month now and like the product very much. I have two issues with the product, however. 1) It takes some trial and error to figure out how to apply it. It absorbs quickly so you have to apply it very deliberately, and it doesn't spread well. I have found the best way to apply it is to pump it onto fingers, do an aesthetician wipe, and then pat/tap it into skin. 2) I got though it quickly. One bottle lasted me a month and I'm already onto my second one. It won't prevent me from purchasing it again but they are relevant complaints.",

For anyone who avoids perfume/fragrances as much as possible in the products that you put on your face like I do, I think this is an amazing cleanser. I have dry cheeks, and if a product is too drying for me I know immediately because my skin there starts to flake off, and I have had no problems with this cleanser. I also have moderate acne flare ups on my cheeks, jaw, chin, and forehead areas all throughout my cycle, but in combination with sensitive skin I don't use cleansers formulated for acne as they tend to be too harsh for me. All in all, if you're not looking for a super deluxe cleanser that will change your life, and you just want something to make your skin feel healthier and more calm, this is a great one! And you can't beat that price, for a broke college girl! Thank you, Etude House, and thank you SOKO GLAM! ",

I’ve used several other water cleansers and they say it doesn’t dry out the face but it did. This is the only one where I can wash my face and not need to splash a hydrating toner/essence right away. I wish that it was “bubble free”, I prefer it to have some kind of foaming texture of some sort so I can see that I have it all over my face. It’s a plus that there is no scent. ",

There is so much product on one stick that I use one side one day and the other side later in the week (I mark the side I use and store it in its original package and then in a sealed bag).

I've used these ones twice now and i am super impressed, both of the cystic pimples i used them on were significantly reduced in size and they no longer hurt. these are expensive but worth it for those really stubborn, painful and deep pimples and i will continue to use and purchase these because they really do work!.

It does sting a tiny bit of you get it into your eyes, but I just keep my eyes closed a few extra seconds and it’s fine. It’s also ALOT of product- definitely worth the price! I use it very liberally (3-5 sprays, 2-3x daily because it feels truly amazing on my skin) and I’m probably only 1/4 of the way through after a month or so. I honestly can’t say enough good things about it!!!",

In the end I decided to go for it during the recent TG sale. I can't believe what a difference it makes. Two pumps have left my hair incredibly soft, minimizing flyaways. I found that the blow drying time was not increased, as sometimes happens when applying a protective cream. The softness is pretty incredible. It is pricey, but it looks like it will last a long time. Did I already mention it will leave your hair really soft? ",

It seemed an icky idea, but I did not regret this one bit. I live somewhere hot and humid, and spend most of my time at work in dry air condition, so I had to find the perfect balanced moisturiser that would hydrate deeply yet did not feel heavy on the skin. The product is slimy, yes, but when I rub it on my face, it melts into this light gel-type consistency, and then gets absorbed quickly. It leaves a light dewy look on my skin and keeps my face hydrated throughout the day. I am using this for two years now and I still am pleasantly surprised by how the product melts into my face. Tip: use a mini spatula to scoop out the cream to minimise mess. I keep it under the lid (above the white plastic cover thing). Will definitely repurchase and recommend. It has lightened acne scars and slowly but gradually lightened my sun damaged skin. LOVE THIS! ",

After buying this i bought this for my mother to incorporate for her dry aging skin. I will mention that when i first used this mask i didnt know when to use it. I was too excited and slapped it on before thinking. I used it somewhere in the middle of my routine and applied the vitamin C and a moisturizer AFTER and it seemed like it did not soak everything else in as quickly. I later took my time to read more and decided to do the vitamin c first, wait 10-15 mins and apply the mask last and i feel like this allowed all of my other products to soak in seal it with the mask layer.",

This actually saved my skin last week when my Retinol hit me too hard one night. I was red, flaky, dry and sensitized and this really helped bring everything down.

I used it when I moved to Hawaii and had more oily/combo skin and it again didn't work well. It never felt like I did anything other than put oil on my skin.

The night cream is so cooling and I love how my skin feels afterwards.

   "Review": " I wanted to like this aloe soothing gel because redness is one of my skin issues and I generally love propolis. My sister gave it to me after she found that was not moisturizing enough for her dry skin. There are several issues with it. First, even though it is fragrance-free, it is not without a smell. Something along the lines of a stale pencil eraser that has been sitting in your drawer forgotten for too many years. I find it off-putting to put on my face because it seems like something you should use in your garage, not in your bathroom. Second, it is definitely not for dry skin types. I personally have combination skin, and even would only use it in the summer months on my t-zone. It leaves my skin feeling tight even after it absorbs. I need to use another moisturizer on top. Third, I am fairly certain that this product actually caused more redness and breakouts than it helped to solve. I stopped using it after a week and will only use it if I get a mild sunburn on my nose. ",

I tried a cotton pad once but did not like the experience at all. Of course those were processed cotton pads so I totally had the wrong idea. These are perfect and now I wish I’d been using them all along. First, you get an incredible amount for the price so I will always have some on hand. I love that they can soak my toner right in, but also put it right back on my face. I don’t feel like I’ve wasted anything and the added benefit of picking up residue makes it even better. Also, these help me use all of the extra essence in my sheet mask packs so I can stretch those even further by making a second sheet mask. Thanks Charlotte and Co. for picking these out for us. I love the idea of more products that we can use WITH our skincare products. Maybe some Soko Glam branded merch in the future?",

It was oddly stripping on my skin, and I never provided any of the touted skin-soothing benefits. It feels pleasant on the skin when kept in the fridge, though, so I think some would find it enjoyable. Overall, I’ve just tried better toners. ",

   "Review": " I have had relatively good success with these for those deep, cystic pimples. You feel great putting them on because you can actually feel the tiny little 'needles' going into the pimple, so you just mentally feel like it's working. Keep expectations realistic - it's not a miraculous pimple healer but I think it does reduce the severity and length of the pimple's life! Not really suitable for surface white heads - recommend Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patches for that. ",

A little goes a long way with this cleanser, all you need is a pinch for your whole face. It lathers up quickly and doesn't leave a tight or burning sensation afterwards. The description states a rose scent which I was worried about at first, but it is very faint. Overall I'm happy with the product! ",
