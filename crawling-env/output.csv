6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,2,Sun M.,Combination,55+, The secret to smooth skin! , This product 100% helps my skin feel smoother and brighter. I cannot recommend this product enough. 
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,2,Alex,Combination,55+, Love the way it feels! ," I use this product as a toner in the mornings and I love the way my skin feels afterward. Over time, my skin did feel smoother to the touch, so I couldn't recommend this product enough! "
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,Chevonne S.,Combination,35-44, Still new to using this product ," I applied it to my face for the first time last night. It was VERY RICH and heavy imo. I am not sure if it is a good or bad thing yet as I would need more time to discern this, but for now, I think it feels too heavy to use during the day time if you're going out. If you're just going to stay home the whole day (or in my case work remotely), then I think it's fine to use it during the day too. But if you plan on heading out shortly after your facial routine, I personally wouldn't use this before an outing as it feels too rich. I will be back to update this after a few weeks/months to see if I see/feel any difference from using this cream. "
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,Gale C.,Combination,35-44, So smooth and smells great. , So smooth and smells great. Nice thick cream and my skin feels so moisturized. 
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,Sun M.,Combination,35-44, The ultimate anti-aging and moisturizing solution ," I've been using IOPE's Super Vital Cream Rich for a few weeks now and I have to say, it's a game-changer for my skincare routine. Not only does it deeply moisturize my skin, but also leaves it feeling smooth and soft. It absorbs quickly without any sticky residue, and I've noticed a big improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. "
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,Sabrina,Combination,35-44, So Moisturizing!!! , 
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,LW,Dry,18-24, My skin is glowing! ," This cream is beyond good. It makes my skin look like a baby's bottom lol. I usually have dull, dry skin that I can't seem to kick but one swipe of this on my face and my complexion is completely renewed. I'm obsessed!!!!! "
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,Sun M.,Dry,18-24, Amazing results ," I've been using IOPE's Stem III Cream for a few weeks now and I have to say, I'm really impressed with the results. The formula helps to calm and deeply moisturize my skin. I also appreciate that the packaging is sustainable, with a recycled plastic cartridge that can be refilled as you use the product. Highly recommend! "
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,Rita V.,Dry,18-24, I love it! , This amazing cream makes my skin so soft and hydrated! I did under estimate this cream and now it’s my next go to ! I love it! 
6.86E+12,Stem Ⅲ Cream,IOPE,$70 ,4,Vivian O.,Dry,18-24, Disturbingly good ," I love this product. It’s totally unscented if that’s a concern, and it’s relatively unassuming as far as packaging goes, plus it has a refillable option making it very eco friendly.  "
6.86E+12,PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum,IOPE,$50 ,2,Mac,Combination,25-35," incredibly gentle, crazy effective, one-step makeup remover and cleanser "," i gotta say i was skeptical when this didn't feel like your typical cleanser or makeup remover jelly (I had bought Plenaire's before this, and it's fine but this is infinity times better). My tip for using Night Off is water makes all the difference - the consistency goes from being pretty thick and not very jelly-ish to slippery with minor suds. it takes ALL the makeup off with zero to minimal rubbing (and you really only need to rub if like me you like to wear triple coat mascara & tightlined eyeliner). I couldn’t believe it - the only time i’ve had makeup come off this easily was with Clean it Zero but Night Off is less oily and actually cleanses (ie not just taking makeup off). I really love this stuff, i’m saving so much money and time relative to my old cleansing routine. i’ve been using for ~2wks now and can safely say i’m never going back. "
6.86E+12,PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum,IOPE,$50 ,2,amandaherrr,Combination,25-35, So clean! , This cleanser has left my skin so clean and smooth! And most importantly it does remove my makeup with one wash!! I have dry skin and after wards it leaves it a little bit dry but I follow with a hydrating toner and it's no problem. This is such a unique cleanser and I am always impressed my this brand! 
6.86E+12,PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum,IOPE,$50 ,4,Eleanora S.,Combination,25-35, Pleasingly surprised! ," I'm super picky about the face sunscreens I use (mainly stick with EltaMd UV Clear with Supergoop unseen sunscreen as a runner-up), so I was surprised to find that I really enjoy this one! It comes out white but doesn't leave a white cast. It doesn't have the gross sunscreen smell I hate and it goes on light and leaves this beautiful glow--not oily or greasy at all! For reference, I have combination skin that leans dry + acne prone. Definitely recommend this one! "
6.86E+12,PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum,IOPE,$50 ,4,Sun M.,Combination,25-35, The perfect sunscreen’ ," Wow, this product is absolutely amazing! Not only is it incredibly effective at what it does, but it's also super lightweight and absorbs into my skin in no time at all. Plus, it's so sheer on my skin that there's no residue or cast left behind. I absolutely cannot recommend this product enough – it's an absolute must-have! "
6.86E+12,PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum,IOPE,$50 ,4,Rita V.,Combination,25-35, I love it ! , I love how it’s a lightweight sunscreen and has a nice smell. 
6.86E+12,PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum,IOPE,$50 ,4,Vivian O.,Combination,25-35, Amazing & Cast-free , This product is great. It’s not fragranced at all and has absolutely zero cast. I apply using the 2 finger rule so using a liberal amount of product and even before it’s fully absorbed I knew there’d be no case on my dark brown skin (think the great Coco Jones’ skin tone) so that’s saying a lot.  
6.86E+12,Air Cushion SPF 50,IOPE,$42 ,5,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35, Very good ," Been using this serum for a few weeks and I’ll be honest- it’s definitely not an overnight game changer, but I do really like it. I definitely had to give it time to see how it works and personally I need more than the 4-5 drops. I use the whole dropper’s worth but I do think it had made a difference in the overall texture and look of my face. I think with the caffeine I do see less puffiness in my face as well. It goes on lightly and is not greasy which is nice and it doesn’t pill under any products I’ve used. Not sure I’ll buy again but I’m definitely going to finish the bottle! "
6.86E+12,Air Cushion SPF 50,IOPE,$42 ,5,Jaime T.,Dry,25-35, Probably too soon to tell , This is a very nice serum. It has a great texture. I can tell that it has strong active ingredients because my skin is reacting to it similarly to when I started Tretinoin. However I haven’t really seen results yet. It’s only been a couple of weeks so I’m going to use the entire bottle before I make a final judgement. So far so good though. 
6.86E+12,Air Cushion SPF 50,IOPE,$42 ,5,Becky E.,Dry,25-35, Love this product! , Noticeably reduced fine lines the first time I used it. 
6.86E+12,Air Cushion SPF 50,IOPE,$42 ,5,Rita V.,Dry,25-35, I love it! , I love how my skin looks refreshed. This is my next go to! 
6.86E+12,Air Cushion SPF 50,IOPE,$42 ,5,Jessica,Dry,25-35, The best lifting serum I’ve ever tried , I apply this on my skin every morning and night. It really works and gave my skin a fresh look. Has really helped my skin lifted and hydrated so much! My skin is smoother and hormonal breakouts much decreased. Can’t wait to try more of their products! 
6.85E+12,Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask,COSRX,$6 ,200,LSon,Combination,35-44, Love love love , I can’t tell you how much I love Iope’s cushion foundation. I have combination sensitive skin and it provides the right amount coverage (not too much) and does not dry me out. It gives me the perfect clean and natural look! 
6.85E+12,Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask,COSRX,$6 ,200,Kitty,Combination,35-44, Feels amazing on my skin ," I love the way this feels on my face it's almost like silk. The vanilla color is a perfect color match for skin, which I was worried about.  "

6.85E+12,Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask,COSRX,$6 ,200,Karina L.,Combination,35-44, ," The coverage is light to medium if you build it up. It does cover redness well, but not pores. "
6.85E+12,Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask,COSRX,$6 ,200,Danielle S.,Combination,35-44, Fabulous Compact Foundation , 
6.85E+12,Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask,COSRX,$6 ,200,Danielle,Combination,35-44, Iope Air Cushion XP ," I had used the ""Live tinted"" spf/primer by Hueguard before putting this on and that primer spf is absolutely horrible for me, it doesn't blur my pores and is extremely oily not dewy, so that could be why it didn't help cover the pores. "
6.85E+12,Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask,COSRX,$6 ,200,Soko Glam,Combination,35-44, , That being said this foundation helped get rid of the Very oily look and gave me a decent dewy finish. 
6.85E+12,Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask,COSRX,$6 ,200,Lia,Combination,35-44, ," Unfortunately it does cake a bit in the typical areas, corners of nose, mouth and bridge of nose where it meets the eyebrows. ALL foundations cake on my face though, I've never had one that didn't! This one did the least so that's nice. "
6.85E+12,Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner,COSRX,$17 ,29,Sandra M.,45-54, No, Nice ," I cannot believe it took me this long to find out about cosrx. Nice gentle cleanser. I've been so conditioned to use foamy cleaners that have been stripping my skin for so long. I have mature normal skin and I enjoy this cleaner, my face doesn't have the tight feeling when I wash it off "

6.85E+12,Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner,COSRX,$17 ,29,Ashley B.,45-54, No, Defective bottle ," I recieved the cleansing oil. Upon use of the pump, it leaks out the sides and not through the tip. I've had to transfer it to a different bottle. I have not used often since it is difficult to use with the current bottle. "
6.85E+12,Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner,COSRX,$17 ,29,Idania C.,45-54, No, My Favorite Cleansing Oil ," I normally use the Cica Cleansing Balm for the first step of my double cleanse, but the balm has been out of stock. I got this cleansing oil to temporarily replace the cleansing balm, however, I actually like this better than the balm. I believe that the citrus oils in this oil cleanser are making my face look brighter, smoother, and clearer. The texture is not as 'slippery' as the cleansing balm (which is obviously thicker), but it is nonetheless effective in getting my face clean without stripping it. I also love the smell. All I need is one full pump to get a good cleanse, which makes this very cost effective. I follow up with the Cica Cleanser; truly a perfect pair for my oily/sensitive/acne prone skin. "

6.85E+12,Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner,COSRX,$17 ,3,Tristan,Combination,18-24, Lovely and Doesn’t Irritate ," Before I start the guts of my review, I should preface that I am 24 years old, with acne prone and combination skin. My skin is not very sensitive, and I did not use this product in my face, and I use prescription adapalene gel for my acne and I was sent this product free in an exchange for a review by Sokoglam. "
6.85E+12,Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner,COSRX,$17 ,3,Claire,Combination,18-24, It's so great to have pure 0.1% retinol ,"Now, I used this product on my neck nightly since first getting this product. Now, I normally wouldn’t use a retinal right away nightly, and I would space out and ladder up my applications in time, but since I carry most of my skin care down to my neck, I felt comfortable with the frequent application. I find the product itself to be thicker than expected, but easily spreadable. It had a yellow hue and an interesting scent to it, but it is not unpleasant. I like to use this before I put my normal moisturizer over my neck. I’m the two month since using this product, I have noticed a reduction in hyperpigmentation from past acne and the fading of past acne scars. I find this product mixes well with most of my other skin care products, other than certain actives, like BHA. (I would not normally recommend or use Retinal or BHA together in a routine, but for the sake of the review I did for a few times) I would recommend this product for someone looking for a low irritating retinal that pairs well with other products. I will say though, for the price, as much as I like it, I probably won’t repurchase in the future in addition to the Rx Retinoid I currently use. If you have the change, and want to try this product, I would recommend this product for you, as I’ve seen results in a short period of time. "
6.85E+12,Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner,COSRX,$17 ,3,Sun M.,Combination,18-24, Amazing product! , This is my 2nd retinol and it is so effective. It seems my wrinkles are getting faded.

This toner is gentle and refreshing, I really like it. The only thing is, the spray is very intense like soaks my whole face in liquid with one pump...which I guess is great for product longevity! "
6.85E+12,Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner,COSRX,$17 ,65,Huy T.,35-44, No, Super gentle and soothing ," I got this product on Amazon and I got to say, I love it! The water is very gentle and doesn't sting my face or neck. I use this everyday, morning and night, and especially when my face is inflamed by some other products or actives. I like that it comes with a spray that allows me to easily cover a wide area without having to manually rub to spread the liquid. This product has a refreshing scent but is not overly fragranced. I think the scent comes from the Centella asiatica leaf water and not some essential oil so I think it is safe for people with sensitive skin to use. Overall, I would purchase this product again. "

6.80E+12,Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening,BANILA CO,$24 ,25,Brandy G.,Normal,>55, Nice Moisturizer! , I have normal to oily sensitized skin and I have to say I really like this moisturizer for summertime. It's non-irritating on my skin and feels very hydrating. I also feel my skin is a little brighter. The only thing that might hold me back from repurchasing is the price. I'll have to see how I feel after I use it all up. 
6.80E+12,Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening,BANILA CO,$24 ,25,Rachel L.,Normal,>55, Nice but underwhelming ," I am torn because I can actually use this without an allergic reaction or breakout, which is so rare for me, but it is kind of blah as far as moisturizers go. I was really hoping for a step up in moisture for the winter, but instead I am adding it as a step before my normal moisturizer. It would be great in the summer or a more humid climate maybe. I do like the feel though! "
6.80E+12,Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening,BANILA CO,$24 ,25,Jing W.,Normal,>55, Lovely Moisturizer ," This feels like a hybrid between gel and cream. Feels super lightweight, but definitely moisturizing and not sticky. I’ve used it with serum and without. I did not experience any dryness. For context, I have combination skin and experiencing fall weather in Canada atm. I like the squeeze type packaging. Only thing is that you gotten be careful to let it stand upright. There is also barely any scent which I appreciate. "

I love that it's a slight more viscous of what u may think of as a toner, but its still thinner than a serum. Its just lovely & nourishing & fragrance-free & that perfect hydrating step.

WOWWWW!!! This morning my face was smooth and my enlarged pores had shrunk! I looked at the areas where I had placed the product, and the wrinkles were replaced with smooth skin!

The toner is so so refreshing. The serum is easy for my skin to absorb (my skin often has a hard time absorbing product which then leads to a goopy feeling on my face).

But I’m so glad I bought this and this is definitely something that will stay in my cabinet. It has some viscosity that it is hydrating. But since I have very dry skin I need to do several layers. This helps balance my skin and keep my pores clear. Since we’re still in the colder months it’s not quite hydrating enough to follow up with sunscreen, but I know once it gets warmer and the viscosity it has it should be. Very excited about this product "

6.81E+12,The Hyaluronic Acid 3 Serum,COSRX,$25 ,79,Cara,Dry,No," Soothing, moisturizing- might repurchase ", although this product did not eradicate the redness I developed during the winter in my cheeks it does soothe my skin. I use this product after toning with my indie lee toner and follow it with an additional essence the snail mucin. Maybe I am not using it with the right products to eradicate the redness? Or perhaps I have not used it for long enough. Regardless I am enjoying how this product feels on my skin and it is certainly non-irritating. A Soko glam representative advised me to purchase this and I think they made a strong recommendation.

I tried products that I've used in the past to no avail, the skin between my shoulder blades just became intolerably dry and itchy and I was having dry patched on my arms. I even resorted to a product that was for healing skin and had petroleum oil (which I've never resorted to before) and they made it all worse. Even with a prescription steroid cream it was not getting better. This lotion caught my eye during the Holiday sales, and though many products claim to heal the skin, I was in such a state, I figured it couldn't hurt.  "

I tried to use it in different steps of my skin care step and searched how to use it for people with dry skin. I even tried using this when my skin was a bit wet.

It's great for warmer and more humid temperatures and I think it would be good for acne-prone skin since it's so light. The green tint does fade and works in nicely to your skin to help reduce redness, but it'll take a little bit of time for it to absorb. The only reason I docked a star was because I love the idea of a pump for dispensing but sometimes the pump is a bit finicky. "

I saw this and was hoping it was a much more affordable version of Dr Jarts green tiger balm. Guys this stuff is tinted, and supposedly adjusts to your skin tone. LOL.

As compared to the Charlotte/CosRx lightning serum, this one seemed to: oxidize and even dry up quickly (it turned dark yellow soon after purchase and seemed like some of the serum evaporated), did not offer the same results (the lightning serum offered results within 3 days for my acne-prone skin and I didn't see any results with this, not as ""elegant"" in feeling (this one is tackier and has a smell). Hoping it was a fluke and happy to review again if I have different results with the next purchase. "

It is hydrating, and so comforting on my skin. I use it as a moisturizing serum, but it also helps with my skin texture as I am at the lucky age where I am fighting wrinkles AND breakouts. It provides a beautiful glow without getting sticky and layers well with others. I was using a different brand of snail mucin and when I went to restock it was sold out so I got this insead. This one is an even better price and my skin loves it. I use this daily - its very thin so it's suitable under heavier serums and moisturizers. I also love to put this on right after I use an exfoliating mask because it is so soothing and hydrating. "

I purchased this one on a whim, and I'm glad I did. In the last three months that I've been using this product, I've seen more results with this snail mucin than I ever did with the other brand that I had been using for the past year. The tone, texture, and hydration of my skin have improved drastically. I have dry skin that flakes off, and I have to exfoliate daily. With this product, I've gotten to the point that I only have to exfoliate one time a week now. My skin looks healthy and hydrated. This will now be a full-time replacement for the other brand. "

I didn't notice any significant differences, and my skin even felt a bit stiff/dry after applying in comparison.

I have pretty sensitive skin so I don't like to splurge on a product in case it irritates my skin, but this recent black friday I was running out of my hyaluronic acid serum and decided to purchase this as a replacement. Each day my skin looks clearer, less red, and has less scars than the day before. I have dry-combo skin so I will add this isn't as moisturizing as I thought, so for dry skin I would recommend pairing this with a moisturizing essence. "

6.72E+12,Double Action Exfoliating Cleanser,the klog,$15 ,47,Carrie,Normal,25-35, Miracle in a bottle. ," I was in the market for a new face wash and decided to take a chance on this one, and I'm glad I did. Not only is the price point decent, but you also get a good amount in the bottle for what you pay. The pore-cleansing oil feels very silky when you're using it. I tried it two different ways. The first was by taking my makeup off and then washing my face with the cleansing oil. The result was incredible, your face feels silky and smooth, the makeup is cleared from your pores, and you can see how clean your face is, as well as feel it. The second way I cleaned my face was to not remove my makeup first. This way really put the product to the test, but it really works. The pore-cleansing oil makes it look like it melts the makeup off of your face as you're washing it. The results are almost identical. You do get a better cleanse by removing your makeup first. For example, stubborn mascara, things like that. But if you're just too lazy or not feeling well, you can still wash your face with just the cleansing oil, and it will still take it off. You might just have to use an extra pump of the face wash. Personally, I think that's pretty impressive when other face washes I've tried can't even do that. "

6.75E+12,Superhue,Live Tinted,$34 ,40,Erika,Combination,25-35, ," I have extremely dry skin and have to exfoliate daily. Over the years, I've spent a lot of money on some products that cost three times as much as this -who claimed to do what this one does and didn't. What I love about this face wash is that first, it has this cooling effect when you use it, so it's nice and refreshing. Also, it isn't extremely harsh on your face. My skin is so incredibly dry that it flakes off, so I was using three different products that are very harsh and cause a lot of redness to your skin after use. This one does not do that. It's very mind and has a soothing and gentle effect when washing your face. Another great thing is that it doesn't leave your face feeling extremely tight and dry after you wash it. You just feel nice and refreshed. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an exfoliating wash. It has eliminated everything else from my regimen. "
6.75E+12,Superhue,Live Tinted,$34 ,40,Soko Glam,Combination,25-35, A little goes a long way ," I bought this a while back and finally got a chance to use it. I was excited to try this because I love the Klog pimple patches. The cleanser does its job, without over stripping. It's winter in NY now and I definitely don't feel like my skin is tight and parched after cleansing and I pair this with the Klog's oil cleanser. I'm not a fan of the cooling effects. I think it is way too overpowering and I have very sensitive eyes, so I am nervous it will irritate my eyes if i continue to use it. i also do not like the scent of the cleanser. Overall, it's not bad, but definitely not something I would prefer or repurchase. "

Alone these ingredients are good but combined are a powerhouse for preventing or treating breakouts, maskne issues like irritation, and reducing redness and inflammation - all while making my skin feel nourished and not like it is covered in grease. Adding so much tea tree is such a bonus for me too as I'm immunocompromised and keep it in the house to add to practically everything anyway. Also the astringent properties of the Willow Bark is great for my pores on my nose and forehead, yet It isn't drying for my skin, and doesn't make me peel.

When I went to open this I noticed on the bottle label it said “Cautions: people with allergy to aspirin will react poorly to the betaine one salicylate.” No where on this product page does it say that. I decided to put a little drop on the back of my hand to see if it’ll be okay and needless to say I definitely felt a burning sensation followed with an itch. I am so bummed I cannot use this because I am allergic to aspirin and unfortunately I cannot return it because I already opened it.

However, after using it in my routine for a few days I started noticing heavy irritation along the lower half of my face so I stopped immediately.

It leaves a slightly sticky film at first, but that goes away after patting it into skin with hands or a face roller. I've only been using the ampoule for about 2 weeks, so I can't say much about long term results yet. It's definitely very hydrating.

I'm rating 3 stars not because I have any complaints about the product itself but because I cannot use it on my whole face. I have newly developed eczema spots near my eyes and this product's packaging states not to use it on eczema at all--a detail that is missing from this web page!

I was skeptical when I read the directions stating it should be applied from scalp to ends instead of the usual midlenghts to ends but I followed the directions and I'm glad I did. Even if it didn't restore the shine I'd still buy it again based on it's price point and the fact that it conditions without weighing down my hair. Will definitely repurchase.

They are so full of moisture though that even with the salicylic acid they can be used as an essence pad or left on for a few minutes as a mask.

Though, this doesn't seem to be the case anymore and I may need to purchase the mask. In conclusion, this is a great shampoo for those who have dry and itchy scalps and I will definitely be repurchasing this once I run out! "
6.65E+12,Jade Facial Roller,GLOWIEST,$28 ,8,Asha,Normal,25-35, Sadly disappointed ," I used many British M products and was excited to try a shampoo that purports to alleviate breakage and damage. Unfortunately, this shampoo did not work for my hair. I always do a double cleanse and even still, I can feel the oils and buildup on my scalp. It made my hair look limp and lifeless and totally dried it out (even with a conditioner!). This did not work for me but hopefully it works for others! "

I tried using it again, but this time double cleansing with this shampoo and it definitely helped though still a bit under cleansed for me. I tried again with a stronger shampoo first and then this shampoo second and this seems to work the best for me. I love the way this makes my hair feel which is why I still continue to use it as a second cleanse. The bottle is large and a little goes a long way so I suspect it will last for quite some time. "

Its not sudsy and their barley is a fragrance. But for the black heads my problem area (which is my nose) felt smooth. It cleansed my face well it wasn't drying, just normal. "

And it seems more stable looking than the ones I usually see in the store. I’ve been using the smaller roller for my face though.

6.62E+12,Cafferonic Body Scrub,SNP,$18 ,21,Samantha R.,Dry,>55, Game Changer! ," I've struggled to find a good moisturizer as my skin soaks up everything very fast but it also doesn't like creams that are too thick for everyday use. This is the perfect balance for me, for both summer and winter. I literally noticed changes the next day and omg, it makes my skin feel like silk.. This is going to be my staple for daily moisturizer from here on out. I highly recommend it! "
6.62E+12,Cafferonic Body Scrub,SNP,$18 ,21,Ellemarieg,Dry,>55, Will definitely continue to purchase ," I've been using this for about six weeks now. I'm not sure if it's using this alone, nightly, or that I've been also taking a collagen hydration supplement, but my skin has been looking so much better than it has in the past. I have very oily skin--like oil-slick within an hour of washing oily. It's also ""oily but dehydrated"" which means I have to use a combo of lightweight hydrating products with mattifying ones. Because of all of this my pores are very prominent. (I used to get called strawberry nose when I was younger.) My texture issues have improved so, so much since using this, so much so, that I feel more confident than I ever have to go without makeup. I think it has a mild retinol-like effect because carrots are high in vitamin A, and retinol is essentially topical vitamin A. As I said, I use it at night directly on the skin, no serums before, just an exfoliating LHA toner before, that I put on with a cotton pad. I realized after the first two tries that I need to then layer a mix of two drops of oil plus a hyaluronic acid serum on top, followed by a layer of a very, very lightweight moisturizer. Misting something watery like a witch hazel between layers also helps. If you've been struggling with texture issues, but have been hesitant to use anything retinol like, I think this is worth a try.

It was a very strong artificial fragrance and I tend more to essential oil and natural fragrances. This would be better for someone with a different hair type.

I tried tea bags and cool compresses and everything to bring them down, but they didn't come down as fast as I expected (from breakup experiences past). When I tried the face mask again later in the week, in the morning, the eyelids had lost all the deflation I'd achieved: puff city. I stopped using it, and the eyelids calmed down and didn't puff up again. I did some googling and found this could indeed be related. "

I’d compare it to the Thayer’s cucumber toner. As someone with oily skin, I was truly amazed at how matte this leaves my skin. My skin felt moisturized and hydrated, but without that thick shine oilier products can leave. I do feel like when I use it under makeup, my skin overall looks smoother.

I don't wear foundation or a full face of makeup, but I sometimes used a Fenty pressed powder on my nose and chin, and it sits well on my skin after using this.

The other is that it smells awful, I joke when I use it that it's my ""pond mud"" mask because that's exactly what it smells like to me, a pond or swamp.

I have the whole Sioris line, I use it for morning and night and it's been so gentle and super hydrating! I've been using it for over two weeks (even on the first day I felt the hydration instantly) and it really soothes a lot of the dry skin pains I would usually have in the morning after washing up.

I've used other gel peelers before, the same kind where you are supposed to ""rub off"" dead skin and it just rolls up. I usually love them, but my favorite one has been out of stock so I tried this product. It did not work at all, it feels like it is rolling up/ pill-ing up into little bits as soon as it is out of the tube? It does not actually seem like it is rolling off any skin, the product is just clumping up like elmers glue. Very sad I kept trying it again every week or so, hoping I was mis-remembering. But no, every time it just did not work out. "

I took the skincare quiz and this was one of the recommended products. My skin has been a bit dull and I wanted an exfoliant that was gentle and effective. This is incredible. Seeing the dead skin come off was insane, and then feeling how soft my skin was afterwards? I could hardly believe it. The rest of my products went on so smooth; it’s like this product made the rest of my routine even more effective. I have semi-sensitive, combination skin and had no breakouts or intense redness.

4.67E+12,Lotus Water Cream,ROVECTIN,$20 ,5,Monii H.,Combination,18-24, First Toner Pad , I bought this because I’ve always wanted to try toner pads after seeing Korean skincare YouTubers use them and luckily this was one sale during Lunar New Year so I bought it. I love it! I have some redness on my cheeks so I left the toner pads as like a mask on my cheeks and after absorbing I could tell that my redness faded a bit so I love the formula too. It’s also very lightweight for morning use since I love light formulas in the morning so I highly recommend this product! 
4.67E+12,Lotus Water Cream,ROVECTIN,$20 ,5,Rachael S.,Combination,18-24, I love these toner pads! ," These feel so soothing and also cleansing but if you want also offer super mild exfoliation if you use the barely textured grid side. There is also a ton of liquid toner left in the container so they won't dry out, and plastic tweezers that actually fit inside the tub (huge pet peeve of mine when tweezers and scoops don't fit in the product container) to keep the product clean. I also have the essence, which I love, and have used the sheet masks (also loved and plan to repurchase) and I think I may need the moisturizer too. These toner pads feel like they can do so many for someone with sensitive skin on a budget if you ask me as they can exfoliate, tone, feel similar to the essence, and since I ran out of their sheet masks I bet I can stick a few of these in the fridge and lay them on my face until I buy more. Also 70 pads for the price is a great buy! "

This is not a moisturizer tho. I repeat it’s not a moisturizer. So pls don’t use it as one. I think it’s good to just put on ur problem areas.

I bought this to try instead of a vitamin c serum made with ascorbic acid because I’ve had a hard time finding a good one. This serum feels nice on the skin, is fragrance-free, and is non-irritating. However, I haven’t noticed any benefits to my skin claimed. This product definitely doesn’t deliver the same results as an actual vitamin C serum, and the niacinamide in it I know is good for skin but I haven’t really noticed any effects from that either. This product is akin to putting on a water gel to my skin and that’s it. I also want to note that this product doesn’t tell you the concentration of niacinamide so I don’t think it’s very much and that may be why I haven’t seen much benefit. I’m using the bottle up so not to waste it, but I won’t repurchase. This product was disappointing. "

I have been using the serum for the last three months, and during that time, I have found that it has actually gotten rid of 90% of the dark circles under my eyes, making them look much brighter.

This is more like a gel than a cream, and it has a pleasant, light smell. It absorbs pretty quickly and didn’t sting, give me any redness or irritation, or break me out.

I don't usually have sensitive skin but this product gave me a terrible reaction. This product was recommended to me from the concierge skin consultation and within seconds of applying to my face, I felt it become very itchy and super hot. Using it within the week had led my face to to a very bad breakout that took a few weeks for it to fully recover. This had been my first time going along with a proper skincare routine and led me to quit using any kind of skincare within the future. Thankfully, keeping my skincare routine to just rinsing with water allowed it to heal from this horrible first experience. "

Dry skin is treated with oil/ceramides, while dehydrated skin needs water. No amount of oil improved my skin's hydration, however this little serum completely changed my skin! My skin is back to a normal water content and is dewy and lovely, and my barrier is restored. This serum is excellent for dehydrated skin - I've tried other water based serums but this is my favorite, I'm on my 5th bottle with no plans of stopping. I highly recommended IF your skin is dehydrated. I've seen a few reviews saying it didn't work for them - could be that they need oil not water. If you feel like your skin is dry but nothing helps, give this serum a try! "

I needed something that was less of a water cream and slightly thicker. It’s super light weight and had cleared my skin after a couple weeks of using it. It’s not fragrant so I see it as a hypoallergenic moisturizer. My skin is sensitive and has broken out with the little of changes.

The beveled edges mean that they not only adhere to your skin better, but that they blend into any complexion or skin tone almost seamlessly. There are two different sized patches included, and the sheer number of patches (42 for just $6!) makes this product well worth your money; I use them liberally (as one should!) and don't feel guilty about it afterwards because they're so inexpensive. Using these patches at any and every stage of a pimple—when you first notice the blemish emerging, once you've picked at it, and once it has already started to scar—has helped my skin heal and get back to normal so much quicker. I cannot recommend this product enough!! "

There's a good amount of product in the tube and it lasted a really long time for me. It has great ingredients and I love that it's vegan and cruelty free.

What I really love about this product is that it can be used in a variety of ways successfully. First can be used as a deep conditioning treatment after shampooing with a clarifying shampoo and left on for a length of time and rinsed out. Second it can be used as a regular conditioner left on after shampooing for however long you leave on your conditioner in the shower and then rinse out. Lastly it can be used as a leave in conditioner now this is where it gets really special- on wet hair or on dry as a smoothing balm.

To survive that fourth day I will put some of this balm in- sometimes with a little water sometimes without. What can I say I’m a mad scientist. "

4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$34 ,128,Maria,Combination,25-35, Not quite hydrating enough ," Loved the texture, but it isn’t quite hydrating enough for me. Perhaps better suited for the summer months. It’s a lightweight cooling and refreshing gel texture, but a more hydrating than your typical gel. "

4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$34 ,22,Karen C.,Combination,45-55, A nice moisturizer ," I bought this moisturizer for the humid DC summertime and have enjoyed it so far. It goes on light and absorbs quick, which is nice when I want to put it on and go to sleep. However, for the price, I won't be replacing the pot once it's over -- it's does its job but doesn't blow my mind. "
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$34 ,22,Stephanie,Combination,45-55, Great Moisturizer That Doesn't Feel Oily ," I have been using this for several months, and it's a great moisturizer if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin. I was dealing with some hormonal acne just on my chin (normal skin type on rest of my face), and this leaves my skin hydrated without causing breakouts. I also have pretty sensitive skin and this is gentle with no harsh components. It has a slightly stretchy texture, but smells nice and a little goes a long way. I'm on my third jar of it, and would definitely recommend it for people with oily or combination or sensitive skin. "
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$34 ,22,Tiffany,Combination,45-55, Nice But Kind of Sticky , I like the way my skin feels after I use this. I have oily skin so this moisturizes my skin without making it greasy. There are 2 draw backs for me. One was the fact that it feels sticky as if you're putting glue on you face. The second was the smell. It's not super strong but I'm not a fan of the scent. 
4.36E+12,Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub,UNPA,$12 ,58,Stephanie,Combination,25-35, The best sunscreen ever ," I have been purchasing this sunscreen for about 2 years now and nothing compares. It has a clean mild fragrance, a beautiful sheen, and makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I have two tubes, one for my house and one for my purse. Highly highly recommended for no makeup days during the summer months. "

4.36E+12,Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub,UNPA,$12 ,58,Mariah K.,Combination,25-35, Good amount of product , It's a good sized tube. It doesn't leave a cast on my skin at all (I'm fair to medium olive tone). It smells like sunscreen for a minute or two after applying and then it has no scent at all. I think the shimmer is far too subtle to really notice honestly. 
4.36E+12,Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub,UNPA,$12 ,58,Maria,Combination,25-35, Leaves white residue on skin ," The consistency and texture is good and it applies really well and under makeup. The one thing I didn't like was after it has absorbed into your skin, it leaves some kind of white residue. I thought at first it was from my tinted moisturizer but I tried not using this sunscreen and I didn't have those white marks. The smell is also a little too sweet for me. "
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$10 ,21,Mona,Dry,25-35, Hydrating ," Made my skin much more hydrated, less dry, and more clear. I recommend for those with dry skin "
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$10 ,21,Anna,Dry,25-35, the best moisturizer ever! i don't know why this isn't more hyped up. ," this is my new holy grail. i'm on tretinoin and the sides of my face are dry while my t-zone gets super oily throughout the day. this moisturizer is perfect for my crazy skin! it feels like an ointment but goes on smooth (leaves a sort of satin-y finish, like a primer). it's not wet or liquid-y at all but it is super moisturizing for every section of my face. it noticeably helps me control oil production around my nose and forehead. i do get hormonal acne and this doesn't agitate my skin or ever make me breakout; it's super gentle. i put this on right before i do my makeup and it helps my foundation go on beautifully. i wear makeup often and was looking for the right moisturizer to go underneath for so long. this is a great moisturizer and primer in one and can be used day and night. the only thing is that it's a bit pricey and the tube runs out fast if you use it every day. in my opinion, it's worth it! "
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$10 ,21,Alexis B.,Dry,25-35, Moisturizing yet Light! ," I was looking for a moisturizer that could combat my dry skin, which is actually a new development for me. I used to have ‘normal’ skin, but I noticed it was feeling really dry suddenly. My skin does NOT absorb shea butter very well so was having a hard time finding a moisturizer for dry skin without that ingredient. Gave the Super Ceramide 100 Renewal Cream a try and YES MA’AM it works!! And it’s not heavy feeling AT ALL, which is so surprising considering the thick texture. It isn’t clogging my pores or any negative impacts on the rest of my skincare routine. I am almost finished with my first tube after around 3 months of use and just bought a second one. My new go-to! "
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$10 ,21,RMC,Dry,25-35, Best moisturizer and make-up primer for sensitive skin ," I have sensitive skin (eczema, highly prone to rashes) and this moisturizer is my go-to when I want to hydrate my skin. On the rare occasion that I end up wearing make-up, I always follow my cleanse routine and then use this moisturizer as a primer for a smooth and hydrating base to prevent any flaking for a smooth BB cream application. I don't use this moisturizer daily as it's relatively pricey for less than 2fl oz, but it's great for travel and whenever you feel the need to deeply hydrate. It doesn't leave your skin oily and absorbs quickly, but it does go on thicker than a daily facial lotion. "
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$10 ,21,Elysia L.,Dry,25-35, Heavy but absorbs fast , I like this moisturizer. It is heavier than I am used to but it absorbs fairly quickly and doesn’t leave my face feelings greasy or oily. 
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$10 ,22,kev,Combination,18-24, It's good! , I liked the compact size but at the same time wish it was a little bigger. I think it does a great job doing a gentle cleaning of the dead skin on lips. Although wish the product had more in it because it can be pricy for $12. 
4.34E+12,Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream,SUR.MEDIC+,$10 ,22,Michele R.,Combination,18-24, Cool! , This is my first chemical lip scrub (I've used a physical one before). It's so oddly satisfying to see the dead skin shed off! It's a great addition to my lip care routine; I've always been a lip balm addict and now I'm happy to prep with this bubbly scrub!

3.94E+12,Resveratrol 345NA_Intensive Repair Cream,DR ALTHEA,$27 ,23,Hans T.,Normal,45-55, Best Moisturizer I've Found ," Let me start this with a couple caveats. First, I'm a guy, so it's difficult to find a moisturizer that's not overpowering in fragrance and doesn't contain mineral oil (the vast majority of moisturizers marketed to men contain oil). Second, I work in Antarctica 8-12 months out of the year, always during the winter months if I'm not doing a full year contract, where it's typically below -20c, windy/gusty, with almost zero humidity (polar desert). I also live in Minnesota and am there during the winter as well, typically on the western plains of the state where the weather is almost identical to Antarctica winters, but slightly higher (not much) humidity. (I basically winter year round between the hemispheres.) Third, I'm a Boiler/Furnace mechanic where I work in varying environments such as the aforementioned environments outside, but also including rooms that are potentially above 30c with high humidity (steam).

Whether it's -45c, zero humidity, and 45+ knot winds straight at my face or it's 35c, 95% humidity, and I'm covered in ash, soot, grime, dirt, and oil this moisturizer keeps on going. It's heavy enough to keep my skin moisturized in the coldest, driest, windiest conditions, but light enough to not suffocate my skin in hot, humid, dirty conditions. I would almost consider it be recommendable as a year round moisturizer for a lot of people because of the extremely different environments that I use this in. "

However, this made my skin break out in small, irritated bumps. I suspect maybe it's the niacinamide, which can be irritating, and isn't listed in the ""ingredients we love"" so I overlooked it. The formula is much more ""active"" than I anticipated. It felt more like a treatment than a soothing serum ( I get that maybe I misinterpreted the description!)

The bottle is nice, stores easily and only pumps out enough lotion for your needs so you aren't wasting any product.

The spray is a super fine mist (good, in my opinion) but doesn’t spray widely enough, so it lands in a specific spot on my face rather than coating the whole face. Not sure if that makes sense, but I end up just putting several sprays/pumps in my hand and then applying that evenly to my face. Still a great product but I don’t end up reaching for it daily. "

It’s got a gel like consistency that goes on smooth and keeps my eye area moisturized all day. Doesn’t get tacky under make-up and it dries quickly. Haven’t noticed a huge difference in tightness or color but it’s still early days. However, when I do as about a quarter of the way through the tube, it became incredibly difficult to get the cream out. Not sure what happened, it had been coming out easily before but now it’s like I have to fight it every time to apply. Not sure if it clogged somehow but that’s been annoying. It may be just the this tube in particular but I’m a first time buyer, so not sure if this is a regular issue. "

2.64E+11,Trouble Cure,ACROPASS,$18 ,49,Eva P.,Sensitive,18-24, Love it , This toner really surprised me. At first it didn't feel like it did much but over time I noticed my face felt smoother and the redness from my rosacea went down dramatically. It's a bit drying though so you need a good moisturizer to follow. This also helped control a lot of the whiteheads which was something I have really struggled to do.

I’ve continued to purchase and use the Acsen cleanser since August 2020, but I can’t say the same for this toner. While there’s nothing overtly wrong with this product, I just felt like it wasn’t doing anything for my skin. It felt nice, but I just didn’t see any benefits from it. "

When I first read the reviews, I kind of rolled my eyes and thought, yeah, right. It seems a bit too good to be true. I suffer from extremely dry skin, so bad that it will flake off. I have to exfoliate daily. I have a makeup table full of moisturizers and exfoliators to try and tame it. When I took the chance on this one, I didn't believe that it would do much good, but I was wrong. In the last three months, I have been able to cut down to exfoliating my face from daily to once a week, and I've gone down to one good moisturizer that I know works well with my skin. My skin not only feels hydrated, but it looks hydrated as well. The firmness and elasticity in my skin have improved as well. I don't have a lot of wrinkles; however, the ones that I do have, are visibly reduced. Overall, this has been a really great purchase for me so I will continue to use it going forward. "

I was apprehensive about this toner at first because I had equated toner with Witch Hazel - meaning toner was to me another ""cleaning"" step for the skincare routine (in my mind). This product though actually got me on board with ""hydrating"" toners. I felt my skin tone was more even after using product and the smell is so LOVELY. It's floral but not too strong, and I feel so feminine each time I use it. I love being a woman and getting to pamper myself and this product has a ""romantic"" feel to it - like being in love during Spring time. Thanks SokoGlam! I so appreciate that you offer this product.

I am a lighter-tone South Asian, so really none of the colors are ideal and I am always afraid of looking like a ghost. I went with caramel, and it looks atrocious. The color formulation is waaay too orange. The texture itself is a bit too chalky than I would like (so is the Skin Hero, but it's an otherwise flawless product so I give it a pass). My skin is very dry and this product is super drying and makes my skin feel tight. Especially for this price point, I wouldn't recommend this product.

This was alright, and I used most of the bottle. I was very into the idea of being able to apply an SPF and have some coverage. After a while I kinda decided that it was just a little too heavy and not exactly what I was looking for. Definitely saving it for days I feel like I need a little more coverage. "

Missha 13 Milky Beige is a good match for me, and the Erborian BB Creme in Clair is way too dark, plus it oxidizes slightly after applying. I absolutely love the coverage, wear, and finish on this but the only way I can make it work is adding the LA Girl Foundation Mixing Pigment in white.

4.60E+12,Soko Glam Collegiate Crewneck Sweatshirt,SOKO GLAM EXCLUSIVE,$40 ,454,TP,Sensitive,25-35, Not a fan ," I had high hopes for this toner! I've used other skincare products with aloe before and my skin has loved it. I've been using this toner once daily for the past 2 weeks, and where my skin was clear before, I've been experiencing breakouts and deep set pimples. It also doesn't absorb easily and leaves a tacky texture on my skin. Sadly have to stop using this and go back to my old tried and trues. I guess this comes with trying out new products, but I wish there were more sample options to try before you buy! "

It cleans the face without the oily residue that I can't seem to wash off. Overall, highly recommend this set! "
4.10E+12,Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence,MISSHA,$55 ,5,Wes,Combination,25-35," Cute, but lacking "," This hat's cute, however, I wish the material was cotton instead of polyester. The cap feels really cheap and flimsy. It feels more like a cap you'd get at a dollar store and for $20, you're essentially paying for the Sokoglam branding. It's a shame because it's really cute, but I can't see it lasting long. It's perfect for bad hair days which is what I'm using it for. "

I love how the material doesn't make your head super hot and give you that forehead sweat, but it's still durable. Perfect for running errands, taking walks, the gym, you name it! This is now a staple for me. "
4.10E+12,Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence,MISSHA,$55 ,5,Just M.,Combination,25-35, Nice cap , I got this as a reward. Color is navy blue as pictured and it is made of nylon. The back is an Velcro band. I would have preferred a metal or plastic type adjustable strap instead hence the deduction of a star. Nice reward but I wouldn’t spend $20 for it. 
4.10E+12,Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence,MISSHA,$55 ,5,Kimberly V.,Combination,25-35, So so...it’s cute ," The material is soft but feels thin since it’s not a cotton baseball hat. Also, I would have chosen a different font size for the lettering; it’s pretty small. The font on “SOKO” could have been played with too to give it some fun pizazz. "

3.94E+12,"Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist",KLAIRS,$27 ,35,Jocelyn,Normal,25-35, Toner / Essence ? ," This essence is the first essence I've used so I don't have much experience with it, but this definitely feels like a toner. I treat it like a toner in that this is the first product I'm putting on my face after I've washed it. I haven't had any bad reactions, and it does feel soothing, especially after long days of wearing makeup or being in the sun. "

3.94E+12,"Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist",KLAIRS,$27 ,35,Aly,Normal,25-35, GAME CHANGER! ," So I may have chemically burnt my skin from another product that was packed with harsh ingredients. I needed to repair my skin barrier again and this cica essence completely changed it. I had to quit all my actives and was hyper focused on getting the moisture in my skin. This essence helped when accompanied after a toner and before a moisturizer for me. It is a watery consistency and the bottle itself is simple. I would say the top may over-pour if you’re not careful. Also patting it down and not rubbing it in helps. Overall, Dewy Tree is a great brand and I switched over to their face wash when I bought this one. The combination of both helped me get away from those chemical burns from another product in about a week. "
3.94E+12,"Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist",KLAIRS,$27 ,35,Desirae,Normal,25-35, Hydraglow! , I am obsessed with this! I never knew how much I needed essence in my routine. My skin soaks in all of the goodness and leaves it super dewy without looking oily. This has solved my dry skin problem!

3.94E+12,"Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist",KLAIRS,$27 ,51,Alexandra,Sensitive,18-24, Lovely product though unsure how it will change ny skin ," I am soooo glad I was able to get this for free bua my rewards points because lord the PRICE! Beautiful bottle, smells nice (don't think there's added fragrance) and great size (thought i would get a sample but thanks for the full size soko glam!) I really like using it; I'm into antioxidant rich toners which I believe this counts, and yes I said its a toner I'm sorry but essences are fancy synonyms for toners I said what I said. Don't know if I see a difference in my acne oily combo skin but it's a great way to wipe off excess dirt and makeup without stripping the skin. Unsure if I would purchase though. "
3.94E+12,"Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist",KLAIRS,$27 ,51,Atinla,Sensitive,18-24, Worth the $$ ," I'll start off by saying this is by far the most expensive product in my skincare line at $55. I first bought this for $30 at TJ Maxx and even then thought.... wow this is a lot (separately, would recommend checking your local TJ Maxx/Marshalls for Korean skicare b/c I've seen some Cosrx and Missha products among others pop up in the last year!). I could say unfortunatley I fell in love with it because now I'm shelling out the $$ haha :) One bottle lasts me 7 months though, so if you wait for sales or stock up your points to redeem for this product it really isn't that expensive to only spend it twice a year! This is a super lightweight essence (more akin to a toner I suppose). I use it as my first step in my morning routine. I've come to love the earthy smell - and of course I just immediately fell in love with the packaging itself! Wow it just feels so classy with the brown frosted glass packaging (the glass is, I suspect, the main reason for the high price). The ingredient is almost 100% mugwort extract, which I didn't know what it was until looking into it and I'm glad I purchased and discovered this ingredient! I think it's really helped clear any acne from my skin and combat the small breakouts I do infrequently get. Again, I know it's pricey but the ingredient is one you should include in your skincare (from Missha or elsewhere), and one bottle lasts about 6-7 months! I would recommed you at least try a bottle and see if your skin benefits :) "
3.94E+12,"Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist",KLAIRS,$27 ,51,Anela S.,Sensitive,18-24, Can’t go without this ," My husband and I both love this so much. We both have sensitive skin.

So far no complaints! It does the job and it's quite a nice brush overall. Excellent for cleaning the brush too as it's got holes in the brush and isn't a paddle brush. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't feel it was as strong as my old brush. It takes a few tries to get through tangles compared to before, but I think it's due to this brush being slimmer than my old one. I have very thick hair which doesn't help!

Since it's only coconut oil, matcha and beeswax, the consistency changes drastically in cold weather. And I'm just talking inside my house during winter, not taking it with me outside!

I need tea tree in my routine to keep my acne at bay so I picked this up on a whim and it has worked wonders. I use with a cotton pad this after cleansing and before applying my serums.

I see a difference in dry texture patches going away and none of the products in this line burn my face!

This recently has become my SAVIOR when my skin out of nowhere decides the retinol product I've been using for years is too harsh for my skin, when I woke up to my face literally peeling! My skin was so quickly soaking this up & it doesn't leave a greasy feel at all; I started by spraying it on the palm of my hand & gently patting on my face, but I've now realized it's not too much to spray right on. I'm going to ALWAYS keep a bottle on hand for those unpredictable skin days! "

6.80E+12,Real Vitamin C Serum,NEOGEN,$38 ,6,hillary,Sensitive,18-24, I’ve been enjoying this! ," This is a nice body wash. It lathers well and I love the exfoliating value from the glycolic acid. It has helped prevent ingrown hairs! It is fragrance free (free from masking fragrances as well) so the scent is extremely chemically- smells like plastic, slightly unpleasant but a good option if you prefer fragrance free body products!

6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,192,Alexus,25-34, No, Amazing! ," I bought this because I heard that it gets rid of milia (which can only get removed by a professional). I had one or two milia spots for the longest time and after using this product, I just randomly noticed that they were gone! This was really great since it is hard to find products that are specifically meant for milia. I definitely recommend! "

6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,Rachel,Combination,18-24, Great Intro Skincare Set , I must admit to slacking on my skincare this past year. So I decided to get back into this month with a designated routine. This set is amazing for those with Normal Skin. I seriously cannot love the oil cleansing pads enough! They are my favorite product in this set. My skin has no reaction to them and just feels amazingly clean afterwards. PRO TIP: Take a page straight out of Charlotte Cho's Book and massage your face at this point before rinsing it off. Literally the reason why it's my favorite step.  
6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,CatTate,Combination,18-24, Love this system ,"The Egg-Zyme cleanser is the only product I'm debating on switching out. (Routines are not a one size fits all and I knew going in I might have to swap out a product or two). This cleanser just makes my face feel SQUEAKY clean but a bit too tight. It also has a slight small that some may find irritating on the skin. They clay mask also feels good. If you've tried the Aztec clay mask that was trendy, this has a similar feel.  "
6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,Amanda A.,Combination,18-24, Good but one of my products got swapped ,"I love the Toner Pads, but I might be biased due to the Vitamin C and its smell. The Essence and Serum are nice -- but might swap them out for another product only to pick one that's targeted for a specific skin concern. And it's hard not to love a good sheet mask but I feel like you can swap for a cute face mask if you want.  "
6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,Gabriella,Combination,18-24, ,"Now my second favorite product here: THE MOISTURIZER. Listen I will write songs about it. First of all, the packaging is beautiful. I love. Second, it has a fragrance which might not be for everyone BUT LET ME TELL YOU I LOVE. It smells like something my Abuela would wear which brings on the nostalgia. It's super hydrating and leaves my skin feeling IMMACULATE. "
6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,Soko Glam,Combination,18-24, ,"The other product I'm switching out is the sunscreen. This one has a slight shimmer to it and not my vibe. It's summertime, I walk outside everyday and it feels like it sweats right off my face -- not something you want in your eyes.  "
6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,Ana,Combination,18-24, ,"Overall: If you're looking for a routine to start you on the right foot as you figure out your skincare routine vibes, this is it. So pleased. "
6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,Soko Glam,Combination,18-24, , I’ve been using it for about two weeks and my skin is flawless. My pore have reduced in size. Totally wasn’t expecting that to happen. The egg wash is my favorite along with the sunscreen. My only complaint is all of the products won’t run out at the same time. But really how can I complain that there is too much?? I’ll just have to replace the products as I go. I’m happy to see I can purchase them individually. I showed these products to my aesthetician to see what she thought and she was very impressed. 
6.68E+12,Niacinamide Brightening Mask,NACIFIC,$3 ,125,Sue,Combination,18-24, ," Great stuff!

6.63E+12,Plump-Kin Retinol Eye Cream,TONY MOLY,$25 ,12,Karen,Combination,35-44, Very hydrating! , I did the 7 day mask challenge and this is the first one I used. I loved how it felt hydrating throughout the entire time I used it because sometimes face masks get dry after 15 mins but this one I used for almost 20 mins and still wet! After taking it off my face felt smooth and it didn't evaporate completely. I still felt like there was a film of mask left on my skin before I applied my night cream. Highly recommended!

You can tell that this cleanser, when used right, is getting the dirt off every time. I live by this and buy it in two's. "
6.56E+12,Moisture Boost Cooling Marine Concentrate Serum,TONY MOLY,$25 ,17,B,Combination,18-24, liked it! , I originally got a sample sized version and like it so I decided to get a full one. After using for about 2 months I’ve definitely noticed my skin have a smoother appearance. It also felt like it effectively cleaned my skin without being too stripping and it takes off makeup pretty well too.

The oil cleanser is a nice consistency, lasted me over 7 months while using two pumps one or two times a day and is the perfect first step in my skin care regime.

After using it for a month I found it made my skin slightly oily after use and it didn't remove my makeup as well as I hoped it did. It did keep my skin moisturized and not dry. I think this product would do well with someone who has dry skin.

It's like an undo button for bad habits and time itself. My tired eyes and chapped lips, creeping wrinkles are erased like literal magic. It leaves my skin with this buttery, silk finish that is stunning. Important night? Definitely doing one of these first. I use facial wash (cosmic dew) then toner (first essence rx) then a little serum (watermelon dew all over) *then* one of these masks. I try to not ""wash"" it off but just put a little water on my hands, wipe off the excess, then pat/air dry. Then I finish my routine with glow serum and lotion (super ceramide renewal cream).

It’s a decent product — it definitely does provide hydration/moisture and is light enough for me to apply other products afterward without leaving an icky, sticky feeling. My skin has become increasingly dry and dehydrated over the past few years, so I appreciate a simple step like this to boost my moisture levels. BUT I wouldn’t look to it as a “fix” or miracle product, you’ll definitely need additional products if you have dehydrated skin like me. Overall still a great purchase, especially at its price point!

I don't tend to buy face masks very often because they tend to be costly for only one use. I do appreciate, however, that these come with a lot of product inside of them.

I have sensitive, somewhat oily skin and this product is very soothing and calming and definitely helps with redness. It leaves my face feeling smooth, calm and happy. I have used it several times and still have a lot left, so it is definitely worth the price. If you have concerns with sensitivity and redness, I highly recommend this product.

It’s a bit messier than I expected — it’s really just bits of leaf in gel. It doesn’t dry or stiffen such as other masks I’ve used. It remains wet until I wash it off. So, I’m not sure how much it’s really pulling out of my skin, or how much exfoliating or purifying it does. However, my skin looks nice and feels nice and soft post-rinse, and following it up with toner/essence/vitamin c is producing a nice, even result and my pores and rosacea seem reduced. Overall, it doesn’t HURT my skin, and anything that doesn’t make me break out is a win. However, but I’m not sure if it’s really scrubbed, purified, or improved it the way I would expect a mask to.

Overall a good option for a waterless cleanser for sensitive or sensitized skin, though would still prefer a wipe with an embossed side for exfoliating and water-based as opposed to oil-based.

I know the description and directions state that these are “cleansing” pads, but I would go one (or two) steps further with my cleansing routine. I don’t feel that these should in any way, shape, or form, replace the cleansing step as they do not cleanse that well; this coming from someone whom doesn’t wear foundation and on occasion, mascara and eyeliner. I’ve had them for over a month and I’ve tried using them twice instead of double-cleansing and my skin was not happy. My skin needs actual water to start the hydration process, which these do not supply. I believe that these pads would be okay to “refresh” the skin midday or after a workout until you can get home to actually wash your face, but the jar is huge and isn’t travel-friendly. "

I was really excited to use this because I'm going through a flare up of hormonal acne and my pores are looking rough since the summer months are coming up where I live and it's humid. I love the way my skin looks after using this mask, I can't use it everywhere unfortunately because it burns really badly on my cheeks and forehead but the parts I can use it on when it's removed look so flawless. My complexion is even and the acne, while it isn't gone, is certainly dulled down significantly considering a single use. My second time using it I did decide to sleep in it to see if time made a difference and leaving it on overnight on problematic areas was beneficial. I asked a question about the sensitivity on here and support was very quick to get in touch with me and they were extremely kind. I couldn't return the product due to a site error and they helped me find an alternative mask for sensitive skin types, guided me on continuing to use this mask since I did like it's results and even gave me a gift card for the site issue/skin reaction which wasn't necessary but very kind of them.

Also, to address other reviews I read: yes there's a decently strong fragrance but I think it's strong simply because it's being applied on your face (near your nose too) and the smell is pretty floral/clean and the mask does cause intense skin tightening but I kind of like my mask to do that so I know it's dry and getting everything out of my skin (it is a clay mask, after all).

I love the way it melts into the skin and isn’t sticky. I like to apply it to my forehead and the corners of my mouth where I’m prone to fine lines, as well as under and around my eyes. The gold flakes are an added bonus - they make applying this cream feel much more luxurious! I usually don’t write reviews but I love this product so much I couldn’t resist. "

So glad Soko Glam started carrying this product. After using, my under eyes look refreshed and no longer tired. This eye mask is on the pricey-er side, and I don't like how each set is individually wrapped - so much waste in packaging. BUUTTTT it's a fantastic product. Love! "

I can’t tell whether it results in skin benefits, but I do find it helpful for relieving facial muscle tension. It is a beautiful stone and easy to hold. I wish I held the coolness longer, as it starts off soothing and cool but quickly absorbs the warmth from my skin.

The toner has a light minty smell that I really like and it makes my pores look smaller. The cleansing oil I use when I have excess sebum and takes my makeup off and sunscreen really easily and feels nice. The Cica cream is really thick so you don’t need a lot to cover your face. And the serum you get a lot and you only use little to cover your face. Honeslty can’t live without these products!

6.56E+12,Wash All Barrier Relief Cleanser,OLIVARRIER,$28 ,47,archer l.,Combination,No, A great tamanu oil moisturizer ," To the best of my knowledge this is one of only two moisturizers that utilize tamanu oil--the other being Krave (in the same price range when taking size into account). It appears all of the negative reviews are from those who did not do their research on this ingredient so be warned tamanu oil is a fairly heavy oil and has a distinct nutty scent (somewhat reminds me of maple syrup and since Sioris doesn't use artificial fragrances you will be smelling this oil) the main point of contention with all of the reviews under 4 stars aside from one which listed a nut allergy. It is an amazing ingredient that does wonders with skin discoloration, fine lines, dry skin, and a generally calming ingredient for the skin. What I like about this formulation in comparison to the Krave barrier cream is that it is lighter and so can be used in some cases during the day and the scent dissipates quicker as well (for me the scent dissipates usually within 10 minutes though I don't really mind it). And this saves me from having to purchase the oil separately and trying to mix with a separate moisturizer. The sole reason to purchase this product is for the formulation with tamanu oil. If that's not an ingredient you are looking for then there are probably better products for you. If the scent of tamanu oil doesn't bother you are you're looking for all the benefits this ingredient offers then I highly recommend this formulation with the other great ingredients offered and a much lighter experience than straight tamanu oil. If the scent is something you are worried about, tamanu oil is sold as an oil in many health supplement stores for around $10 so I'd highly recommend testing it out there before trying this out. "

I somehow missed some sunscreen once and went over my face again. It didn't like that. I won't be doing that again. I'll add that, even though the page says you can start with it dry like an oil cleanser, it doesn't really have enough slip for that kind of use. You'd have to start with more product than you really need if you wanted to start without water. But I didn't intend to use it that way when I purchased it, so I don't deduct points there. I should also say that I wear rarely wear makeup, so I can't vouch for this product's ability to remove it. "

My skin looked so hydrated and bright afterward. The quality of the sheet is outstanding also. I will repurchase. 
1.95E+12,7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask,LEADERS,$6 ,39,K.K.,Sensitive,35-44, Love these! ," I've been eyeing these for a while but they were out of stock at one point and I was so bummed. Now that I've had a chance to try them, I understand why they were sold out! I love the milky essence and I think my skin tends to get more benefit out of that vs. a clearer/thin essence. the material is really nice. I can't say I've noticed a strong brightening effect but I've really only used one pack so not expecting the world here. Will repurchase! "

1.95E+12,7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask,LEADERS,$6 ,529,Alexa,Combination,<18, A little grainy ," When mixing this into my toner at night I have found that it makes the toner a little grainy at first unless you sit with it and mix for at least a full minute. While this isn’t a problem for me, sometimes I just don’t have time to mix it in all the way so I don’t use it on those nights. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who doesn’t have a lot of time to spend on a skincare routine, probably it would be easier to use a liquid vitamin c product. However if you have the time, I think it is definitely worth it. "
1.95E+12,7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask,LEADERS,$6 ,529,dipika,Combination,<18, didn't oxidize ," i had to be careful while applying this power mixing with lotion or toner, i definitely noticed glow in my skin after using it. I have dry skin so, i applied extra moisturizer while using this. "
1.95E+12,7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask,LEADERS,$6 ,529,terry,Combination,<18, liquid was more effective ," I didn't see a huge difference on my skin with this. I thought this would work based on all the good reviews, but after I tried a liquid vitamin c serum, I found the liquid vitamin c more effective. Maybe because the powder doesn't really melt even after combining it with a toner, so your skin doesn't absorb it as much. I have sensitive combo skin, acne prone, and my scars heal pretty slow. Maybe the results are quicker for other skin types. "

1.95E+12,7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask,LEADERS,$6 ,529,Lanae,Combination,<18, , Love that they made a powder form since I always used to use the liquid version but would turn yellow. Wish there was a place on the product where I could put the spoon because I don't like it touching any surfaces but this product is my holy grail for complexion & texture! It shouldn't be too chalky if you mix it well/use more liquid product. Love! 
1.95E+12,7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask,LEADERS,$6 ,103,Mikayla,Normal,18-24, great product for dry and flaky scalp ," I was honestly skeptical about this product and went in with low expectations, but I've been using this for almost three months now (every other wash) and my scalp is SO much better. My flakes have actually disappeared all together, and although my scalp gets itchy occasionally, its not even half as bad as before. I really love this product and will be buying when I run out. "

I didn't know what to expect so it may take a while till I see more results. It should be apply every 2 weeks. I'm not a fan of the applicator. The best would be with long tube to get better to the scalp while dividing hair.

It fits and sticks to my face better than any mask I’ve tried, and there is SO much product in the packet that I used it the next morning. It left my skin feeling so hydrated and plump and glowing. I will buy this again and again. "
1.95E+12,7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask,LEADERS,$6 ,24,Kb,Combination,35-44, It’s flat and does not fit face contours ," Maybe it’s a good mask if you have a large, flat face. The aren’t enough cuts in it to adjust to fit the jaw and sides of the face. I’m disappointed because it’s a thick fiber and seems to be good quality. "

8419598089,Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence,SKINFOOD,$39 ,60,Nick,Oily,18-24, Worth the Money ," For a long time I used Eucerin. I have dry, sensitive skin and have a number of allergies, so I've been restricted about what I can use. Eucerin never made me react, so I kept using it despite it only kind of helping my skin (it is not appropriate as a facial moisturiser, though). I tried this, hoping I could find something that would pull double duty so I have one less thing taking up space and I'm very glad I did! It is not only very light on the face, it has that really subtle ""unscented lotion"" smell and - I would say - has slightly less of an odour than the Eucerin, though neither are noticeable or offensive. It has taken care of the persistent dry spots that Eucerin had no impact on! If they ever stop making this, I will be so sad. "
8419598089,Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence,SKINFOOD,$39 ,60,Clariza,Oily,18-24, My favorite lotion ," This was my favorite lotion for a while. I first ordered it here on Soko Glam and I ordered again and again in other sites (faster delivery) as it's effective on my hands and body, it did not leave any stickiness it was very smooth and light. Easy to use and light enough to wear under makeup. I would buy again if my budget allows. "

8419598089,Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence,SKINFOOD,$39 ,137,Lisa G.,Dry,18-24, Bee Goodness Trifecta ," This essence came highly recommended, but I don’t know that it entirely lived up to the hype, given the price. I did legitimately enjoy using it. I do think a fair bit of my enjoyment was just due to how bougie the bottle is. If you’re specifically hoping for an essence, maybe look into a different option, as both the packaging (dropper bottle) and texture (not watery) is not conducive to using it as an essence. But in terms of a good moisturizing, soothing serum, this is a fantastic choice because it has the bee trifecta of royal jelly, honey and propolis. I would definitely consider repurchasing next winter. "
8419598089,Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence,SKINFOOD,$39 ,137,Carlee C.,Dry,18-24, Love this! , It’s moisturizing and it makes your skin feel soft. I recently bought a lot of skin care so I’m just trying to figure out what step to make it.
