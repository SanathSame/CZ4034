12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Karie P., Sensitive skin - can't use often ," It's ok. I have sensitive and wanted a little bit more moisture during the winter months. However, I'm thinking the 4% part of this essence made my skin sensitive (think burning and itching) in my T-zone. Particularly around my eyes, and under my nose. It also has a slight scent to it where it smells artificially floral. I can use it from time to time (not consecutive days) and it does make my skin softer, but I wouldn't say it feels more moisturized. "

It's amazing and you don't need much so it lasts a really long time. The combination of this with the snail cream over top is so nice and my skin has the most amazing glow. The hydration lasts all day! I also really like that it does not dry sticky at all. The only other serums/essences that I've tried that even come close to providing this level of hydration have all been so sticky, and since I don't typically wear foundation or even tinted sunscreen that's an issue for me.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Yasmin, worth the hype ," I have seen this product all over social media saying that it was the secret to clear skin, as a person with combination skin I wondered how well it would work for me. The texture can be bizarre at first but I honestly don't mind it, I have noticed it works best after a hydrating toner. Would buy it again! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Alison, Woudl have been 5 Stars ," I love this product, truly I do. I use it right before I moisturize (daily/nightly), and I notice a difference in my skin....soft, glowy, and overall seems to layer well with other products. The ONLY reason i didn't give it 5 stars was, of all things, the pump. I know I am probably an overthinking monster for saying this, but it's a design flaw that detracts from the overall pleasure of using this product. I wish the nose of the pump was longer, or something(?). The short nose of the pump as it is now kind of forces you to awkwardly angle the whole bottle into the palm of your hand. It's hard for me to get just the right amount of product, I seem to always end up with one extra pump than I want because of this short nose. Other than that - it really is a terrific product, and I wouldn't steer someone away from buying it. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Amanda, Disappointed , I don’t really understand what the hype is all about with this product. It doesn’t do anything for me. I was super excited to try it because I’ve been seeing this item pop up everywhere and how it’s such a great product. I don’t usually write reviews but just figured I would since I’ve been seeing such good reviews about views about it. Doesn’t really do anything for my skin :/ 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Melody S., Feels good on skin ," As with the snail cream, It feels great on my skin and has not broken me out. It seems to be super hydrating and I'm really looking forward to seeing how this will affect my dark spots after continued use for a while! The bottle is very large and goes a long way I think it's totally worth the price. EWG scores the Cosrx snail line with a one, which is an excellent score and part of the reason why I decided to give CoSRX a try from my previous brand. If you have never tried to stick to only clean beauty, They can be very helpful for somebody who breaks out. My breakouts stopped when I stopped using products with a lot of chemicals. "

What really made me decide to buy it was a tiktok about hydration test that increased hydration by 30% plus. I am telling you this hydrates. I always had oily skin and when i added this to my routine together with the all in one cream my skin became normal and baby soft in one night. I did not believe those things could actually happen. If you only use the essence and cream alone it does not moisturize enough but if you seal it which i did. I used aveeno eczema daily therapy moisturizing cream. That made miracles. This is so worth the hype. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Mariah K., Speeds healing , It has significantly shortened the amount of time it takes for blemishes to heal up. I also feel like I have been breaking out less often. It's fairly meh as far as moisturizing goes but it's been great for mild acne. I also haven't had any cystic acne since I've started using it; not sure if that can be attributed to the product or if I just have been lucky lately lol 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Taylor, Really nice for damaged skin , This product is a must if you have damaged skin in any way. I have horrible acne and tend to pick at my face from time to time absolutely destroying my skin barrier and creating red splotches that last days. I also just had normally rough and very textured skin and this is the only thing that literally made a difference overnight. I have dry skin as well and I can’t say that this is super hydrating in a way that makes my skin feel less tight but it has 100% healed my skin barrier and completely transformed the texture of my skin. I’ve never had soft skin before but I use this day and night and it’s almost hard for me not to touch my face because it’s so soft and that’s a feeling I used to dream about but never think I’d achieve.

Without it, my skin was red, flaky, dull/uneven, and I had a breakout. Would give more stars if I could. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Rebecca M., I feel skincare gets a ," I feel skincare gets a bad rap for strange and exotic ""miracle"" ingredients that will claim to reverse time and give you the skin of a newborn that turn end up being complete snake oil. This K-Beauty product, at least for me, falls into the ""exotic ingredient"" category. The claim to fame ingredient is snail mucin, which is what you think it is: the sticky, slimy secretion of snails. And the product's texture reflects that image, with a viscosity that causes the product to stick to itself when pumped out of the bottle. Think of a liquidy honey tyoe substance; when you touch it and that gel-like string of honey does not want to let go. However in rubbing it into the skin, it is more liquid in texture than it appears. What this product doesn't do is make outlandish claims. The website says it will help with moisture retention and assist with reducing redness. These are reasonable claims that I believe are validated. I definitely felt like my skin had a juicier plumpness when using this. It is light-weight, unscented and cruelty free. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Caren, 🐌 It’s a 5 star ," 🐌 It’s a 5 star for me! The way my face felt after using this product for 3 days was worth it. Its so soft/smooth. I would say my skin type is normal to dry. I started using this before I applied my makeup and at bedtime and it has already made a difference in the little time I’ve started using it. It goes on slimy at first (hence the name snail mucin ingredient) but instantly absorbs into the skin like water. It’s not greasy or messy and very lightweight. I did notice that the product alone seems to dispense quickly after using 2 pumps per use it’s starting to go quickly. I haven’t really noticed a “glow” of hydration but, my skin does feel better. I have noticed my skin feels tighter and moisturizer early in the morning as I wash my face with cold water. The only other con to this product would be that it is Korean made product and although they have English written on the bottle they did not correctly write the description they were trying to portray as there was a grammatical error noted on the bottle… not a big deal but, if you’re skeptical to use something you can’t read ingredients from.. you should probably look it up first.

I’ll even put this on my neck & chest to help with the fine lines and moisture in those areas.

I’m not sure if it’s supposed to do this, but I find that it has been very soothing and seems to speed up the recovery of current blemishes. Also, it is very hydrating! I use it after I cleanse & tone prior to other serums. The first night I kept making my sister look at how glowy & hydrated I looked. I am a hydration snob so for me to be willing to repurchase something it has to make a difference, and I will be repurchasing this!

I always try to give reviews that will help people deciding to buy it. This product is very similar to the Vichy 89 Serum. And I actually like this one better. The Vichy feels more like water and once it is absorbed I can't really tell a difference, this one actually made my skin feel moisturized and I felt I could skip moisturizer if needed. I think this is better and I will probably buy this one iver the Vichy one moving forward. I also like that it comes in a pump bottle, it makes it more sanitary. This is great if you are looking to do the 7 korean step routine or if you are the type of person that doesn't like the feeling if something on their face (my fiance was okay with this, said he didn't really feel it). It made our skin softer. I will definitely keep using it and buy it with my own money once I ran out. "

The product has little to no scent, which is nice for those who aren't a fan of scented skincare products. I thought this essence did a wonderful job in helping my skin stay hydrated, while giving it a soft texture. Worth trying out! "

My oily area is mainly my T-zone, but after sleeping all night and even after a tad bit of perspiration, my T-zone is just the perfect amount of dewy and I don’t look as shiny as a disco ball! Seeing all these gorgeous summer dewy looks gave me major FOMO with my oily forehead but this product gives me that dewy skin I’ve always been envious of! It’s the absolute first serum that has been super moisturizing without overdoing it. I will say a little goes a long way, so if you use too much it will leave a bit of residue on your face until it dries or you pat it off. But I mean, it’s snail excrement so that makes sense lol! I was really skeptical about trying it at first especially it being from snail but I am soooo glad I did! And honestly $25 will last you a long time. Worth the investment! You’ll probably find me restocking at some point or maybe even gifting some before then! "

It lasts pretty well, I have been using 1-2 pumps, morning and night, for a little over six months now, and I still have like at least 15% of the product left. I will be putting snail on my face until the day that I die. "

This summer had me breaking out like crazy and I don't think this was helping. I couldn't tell if my spots were fading faster or not. My skin looked hydrated, but was probably too heavy to use for oily skin in summer. It dries to a slightly tacky texture, which is to be expected from snail mucin, but seems to create a bit of a film on the skin which I didn't really like. I enjoyed Benton's snail mucin products so if this one doesn't work for you, maybe try Benton. "

I appreciate that this product does have very high percentage of snail mucin, doesn't contain paraben, alcohol, silicone or perfume. I love that the packaging comes in the pump form to avoid contaminations. However, if I could suggest one thing to improve in terms of packaging is to make the package not easily to be opened by anyone. Maybe you could have a sticker seal or some other preventions from people opening it at the store. Thank you again for this wonderful product. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Marco L., I've been using this product ," I've been using this product since 2015. Over the years, I've tried other essences but this is the one I inevitably come back to. My skin type is oily and it used to be very acne prone until 2 years ago (getting away from puberty seemed to help my skin!). This product doesn't produce any noticeable difference but what it did do for me was give such deep hydration. My skin produces less oil when I use it and since my skin becomes very well hydrated, it ""glows"" in the subtle way that moisturized skin does. I ran out months ago and have been flirting with other essences but my mind always drifts back to this. My skin is never greasy with it and I've recommended it to others and they've loved the results as well. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,JenniferB, Not that impressed ," This is definitely not a favourite essence personally. It's way too sticky. Does not feel like it sinks into my skin. But it is moisturizing because of that. So good if you have dry or dehydrated skin. And I've not seen much of an improvement on my skin. Maybe slightly with my skin tone & pigmentation perhaps? Been trying to finish off the bottle, but it's taking a long time to get through it. even though I've been using 3/4 pumps. And sometimes layering twice! Still got half a bottle to go. It's a shame I really don't like or enjoy using this, otherwise I wouldn't mind it lasting so long. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Thep, Very Hydrating , My skin used to be very dry and when I started using this essence I had to switch my moisturizer to normal from very dry formula.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Katherine N., DESTROYED MY SKIN ," BEWARE PEOPLE WITH POLLEN/DUST MITE ALLERGIES!! I had NO idea that there was a link between people having severe snail mucin reactions and having existing allergies to dust mites and pollen. I ran out of my hyaluronic acid serum and wanted a product to keep my dry skin hydrated until my serum came in the mail. I heard rave reviews on snail mucin over the years but never actually tried it until now, seeing that it included hyaluronic acid I was excited to try it. I used this product day and night for a total of 4 days. For the first 2 days I noticed tiny little red patches forming on the apples of my cheeks but my skin is always a bit red in those areas, regardless, so I kind of just wrote it off. I have been battling to try to fill in this one deeper fine line on my forehead for the last 10 months and I was soooo happy that within 2 days, I saw VISIBLE reduction of that fine line while using this snail serum. I was ecstatic!! The 4th morning I woke up and noticed my face looked a bit weird. My skin's texture was almost... bumpy? Which it has NEVER been. The redness had spread further on my cheeks, nose and chin. My face never ever has looked like this before I had no idea what happened to it. I went about my morning skin routine (again applying the cosrx snail mucin after my toner) and my face EXPLODED. Almost immediately my face got really really hot, the redness spread around my entire face and I looked like a firetruck, big blotches popped up on my skin and it burned the whole day long and even into the next morning. My skin has never reacted to any product in this manner before, leading me to do some online research where I found several other reviews of people who had allergic reactions to this product and ALSO (oddly enough) had dust mite/pollen allergies as well (which I do have). I have immediately stopped using this product, it's been 2 days since I've last used it and my face is still red and itchy/blotchy. I wish SokoGlam had put a warning in their description for anyone with these preexisting allergies (pollen/dust mites) that there is a potential link to snail secretion allergic reactions, I hope my face stops burning soon "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Breanne B., My favorite skin care product ," My skin loves this stuff! It absorbs fast and helps reduce redness and irritation. It also seems like my other products sink in a little faster after using it. My mom was intrigued by the ""snail goo"" as I call it and ordered her own bottle.

I had been wanting to try snail mucin for a while because I had heard such great things about how it can improve skin texture and moisture. This was my first time trying it, and it did the complete opposite for me. My skin became dry and irritated. I thought maybe I was allergic to one of the ingredients or something, so I gave it to a friend to try that has very different skin from me.

I asked her how women of her culture maintain such beautiful skin and she said water & snail slime. I figured...what did I have to lose? I’m 44.5 yrs old & doing my best to maintain a lil youthful look. I started to see the results fairly quickly. These picture are taken only after using product for about 1.5 weeks and using a snail slime mask in addition to this product. The mucin almost glues or traps moisture in your skin. Right after using the product And drying you have an immediate Glow. That’s just the slime drying. The real affect for me came after using the product for several days. My skin looks glowing and hydrated. A coupon of cons...it feels just like snail slime on your face so its a little bit to get past that part. It’s cold and it’s a little gooey/sticky. I use right before I go to bed so I can manage it. I also will put on my face right before I use a red LED light. I really don’t know if it makes a difference but worth a shot.

Just love it. "

I think it's helping with my scars and texture. I always see an over-night difference with the vitamin c powder, but this is gentle enough to use every day and my dark patches are shrinking. I've been using for about four months now and repurchased. For ace-prone, oily, sensitive skin with discolouration and fine lines, this is a good essence so far! "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Nuria, Wonderful Hydrator ," I use it every morning (or try to, at least) and over the past three months, my skin's gotten incredibly soft and plump. Some claim that it helps with discoloration, but I can't confirm that since I've been using vitamin C products along side it. For what I can say, it does seem to help with an extent, very faintly and gently removing discoloration over time (my other products specifically for that work much quicker) "

Besides truly nourishing my eczema prone soon (even calming my inflamed skin during flare-ups), banishing sun spots, old scars (discoloration), and helping to keep my skin hydrated without being tacky, this yucky sounding product is simply put: holy grail status.

I think ts skin-soothing properties help the effectiveness of my other lotions and creams (medicated or otherwise) since it seems to keep itchiness at bay, so I'm not scratching at my usual breakout areas. This also makes it a great post-shave moisturizer! Oh, and it's especially great for sun burns! Layer it on the affected area or create a makeshift mask with a cotton pad. This is a forever re-purchase for me. "

I don't even normally have super oily skin, so it seems like this product has done something to change the texture of my skin. I had good results with the Galactomyces 95 Tone Balancing Essence so when it ran out I thought I'd give this one a try, but I'm going to be going back to my safe zone after this. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lauren Y., Perfect for everyone ," I’ve repurchased this so many times and will continue to do so. It is my staple essence. My skin is sooo sensitive, oily, and acne prone. This product is so hydrating yet does not cause break out. Even hyaluronic acid products were too hydrating for my skin. If you have dry skin, another layer of something hydrating will probably be necessary, but this product is so good for pigmentation and healing. It is so soothing when my skin is irritated. Highly recommend. "

I have tried hundreds of products, and this one has definitely become a staple in my routine. My skin is on the drier side and is definitely acne prone. My breakouts are mostly small/mid size whiteheads with the occasional cyst along my jawline. I currently follow a 6-10 step Korean skincare routine. I have found that this product works wonders on reducing redness and pimple size. I also have back acne, and I mix tea tree oil into this product and apply after I apply a toner of ACV & Rose petal witch hazel, and the combination has nearly cleared up the super cystic acne that I recently had pop up about 6 months ago for the first time in my life. I love it! Highly recommend for sensitive/acne-prone skin. "

A great addition to your routine ," THIS PRODUCT WORKS AND IS STRAIGHT TO THE POINT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A SNAIL PRODUCT. It takes some getting use to the slime texture but it dries down to soft skin. I wish I would stick to my CosRx (or Kbeauty) routine because it honestly works just as well as my routine that bare money, unfortunately I'm addicted to skincare, specifically Sephora. Snail mucin does all that the blogs says it does; acne scares because it brightens, elasticity, smooths skin, hydrates, it contains nutrition and because of all of this it helped with my acne.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Michelle, Incredible Healing Power ," This is a potent healing serum. I've been using it a little over a week, and thus far, it has quickly healed a small chemical burn from leaving a chemical peel on too long (and left no scar), and I'm amazed at it's ability to quickly heal a pimple, including those I messed with. It appears to be taking out old acne scars in the short time I've used it. That alone would make it 5 star worthy, but it also makes my skin softer, more plump, and glowing. Oh, and my skin is sensitive to a lot of ingredients, but this doesn't break me out or irritate me at all, so I appreciate the small, focused ingredient list. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Brieanna H., So far so good ," I was definitely a little hesitant to start using something secreted out of a real live snail on my face... but I'm glad I did! It's very healing for my spots of acne and helps with the dryness on my cheeks. It doesn't add tons of hydration for me, but sometimes I dab it onto acne that's already moving towards the healing stage to help speed up the healing process without re-clogging the pore. It seems to work well for that. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Erika A., Does the Job! , The essence is sticky when you first pump it out of the bottle but dries quickly and doesn't feel sticky once it dries rather your skin looks and feel moisturized. The product has not bothered my skin and has helped bring relief to it - reduced redness from acne.

It's now been a week of this, but it looks like my skin is finally balancing out and getting used to the product, so I'm persevering and hoping for the best. I'll write an updated review if I see any positive changes! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Precious N., Feels nice , I like how it feels so smooth every time I apply it on my face. But it doesn’t really last long.

Will continue purchasing this product! Thank you Soko Glam! 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Alli K.," Left skin tight, dry "," I added this into my routine after toner and before serum, morning and night. I was surprised at the first use as to how slimy the consistency is (I suppose that's the snail mucin?). I had to buff it between my fingers a bit to reduce stickiness and then pat it on. After using, my skin felt tight and slightly tacky, which is not good for my dry winter skin. After 3 days of use, my skin broke out into a rash of tiny pimple-like bumps in odd places on my face, and the rest of my face was red and irritated. I virtually never break out, and these weren't like cystic-acne type bumps, so I am fairly certain it was caused by the product. I stopped using it and my skin is back to normal. I know that different people have different reactions to products, so I know it's not the product's fault that my skin had a reaction to it. Still, even before the rash, I was disappointed by the consistency of the product and how it made my skin feel. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Amelia S., My favorite product by far ," I LOVE this, everyone thinks I'm crazy until they try it. I feel so supple and can tell my dark spots are fading when I use this regularly. I only use two pumps and that's good for my face and neck. I will always use this. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Juna D., It's ok , I would say it doesn't break you out but i think it's for people with dry or less oily skin. I suggest for those with oily skin to rinse face then apply the essence on. it does give you a glow after use which is nice. I will continue to use this though. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Yum, Best snail mucin product I've tried ," This lived up to the reviews and my expectations. It's light, absorbs easily, not sticky or smelly, and makes my skin feel soft, smooth and moisturized. My skin tone looks more clear and glowing. No breakouts or reaction from it at all-- it's actually soothing. Love it. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Michelle," Calming,. Restorative Essence for Sensitive Skin "," I've been using Raw Sauce and the Time Revolution Essence but added this into my routine a couple of months ago. While the other two promise moisture and even skin tone, I honestly see the most results with this, much cheaper product! It takes some getting used to (it's a sticky substance, it's snail mucin!), but I save this for night time when my skin really needs some extra moisture and soothing. I feel like this has done a better job at helping my skin fight the winter and recover from hormonal breakouts than any other products that I use (Vitamin C, Madecera Cream, etc.), and I'm so glad I found it! "

So far i have 3 days using it and my acne is clearing! >. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Rachel D., Might Cause Breakouts ," It's highly moisturizing, but I'm pretty sure snail mucin causes me to breakout. My mom tried it out (she has sensitive skin) and she also developed a few breakouts. My twin sister tried it out though and it really works for her, she's been acne free ever since. Not sure why this is happening, but I wanted to give some feedback. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Tristen, I LOVE this! ," I have really dry skin and I incorporate this into my day/night skin routine. It leaves my skin feeling extremely supple and gives it a slight glow. It also absorbs into my skin really fast, I also only use 2 pumps on my entire face. This product has lasted me over a year too. I will forever use this in my skincare routine!! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Sosin, Wonderful on dry skin ," 2-3 pumps of this is more than enough to cover the whole face and neck! Very hydrating, scentless, and it's helped with my acne scarring. I already have a backup for when it runs out. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Nicole M., Doesn’t work well under make up ," This leaves me feeling moisturized, and doesn’t irritate my sensitive dry skin. However, it is somewhat on the tacky side. I usually use this after using toner and before adding a serum and a moisturizer. On days that I am wearing make up I have noticed that if I don’t wait long enough after my skin care routine my make up tends to be difficult to apply and separates not long after application. While it works well at night, I will likely try to find an essence that is more suitable for both my day and night time routine. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Catherine L., So far so good!! ," I have been using this product for a week now as a serum and adding my moisturizers after it. Initially when you pump it out it seems sticky so you don’t need too much but once you put it on your skin the stickiness goes away, it seems light and absorbs quickly. My skin is noticeably softer and smoother after just a week. I am not sure about the hyperpigmentation improvements but I am taking pictures and I think it is certainly going to help make it less noticeable. The price for this product is affordable in my opinion because a little goes a long way. You can use it as part of your skin care routine or alone after cleansing and toning. My skin is pretty normal with hyperpigmentation and some dry patches but after using this my skin seems hydrated and much softer and smoother in tone and complexion. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Jeanette L., A honesty and specific review ," So I've been looking for skincare products and this is my very first essence. The reviews seem to be rly good and there's 4 1/2 stars. So o decided to get it, but, it wasn't as great as I expected. I've been using it for month rn. The product itself feels a little slimy, at first I was shocked but I grew used to it. And it was kinda fun to use, it also stretches or droops like mucus too. Lol. But I learned that a little goes a long way. At first I would use 3 pumps, forehead, two cheeks. But then I realized that I can split one pump into 1/3 for each part. And it works perfectly well. The product itself absorbs into the skin fairly fast, not like the moment it's on. Probably a few seconds later, if u use a lot of products then that might be why it absorbs slower. The product gives u a nice dewy glow, it doesn't feel greasy and it feel refreshing for my skin. The product didn't rly do what it said it would. My skin didn't rly brighten nor did my acne fade. Maybe, the other products I used made this happen but idk. Overall this product makes u feel hydrated and gives a dewy glow but doesn't rly chnage anything. At least for me. U can give it a go if u want to. This product is rly good but it's probably bc the other products I used were not so great. I hope this review helped u, I tried to make it helpful since not a lot of reviews were so helpful. "

This stuff is absolutely incredible. It’s pretty thick and seems sticky at first but, soaks in really nicely and leaves my skin feeling hydrated, calm, and sooo soft. It has definitely helped my skin heal blemishes and I’ve noticed several of my darkest hyperpigmentation spots have faded. Definitely will be repurchasing, and would recommend this to any one wanting to soothe/heal their skin from either dryness or acne. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Emily N., My face is glowing! ," I love love love this product. I apply two pumps in my hands, rub them together to heat my palms and lightly press against my face. (I learned using the heat of your hands helps the essence better absorb into the skin). Not only does it feel good and cooling on my face, it gives me a glowing ""dewey look on my face, which is exactly what I want-- glass skin! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Eunice, not for me ," I've used this for a month and I honestly really wanted to love this product since all the reviews were so good. I have combo skin (dry cheeks and some shine on t-zone at the end of the day), some opened pores and redness. I used it every night and I can tell you, its very hydrating. So hydrating that I'm super OILY/ GREASY the following day, which I dislike. I also noticed my pores were more opened and so visible. Oh, and redness still there. I stopped using it for a week now and my pores are less visible now and no more greasy/ rough looking face. Will not be using it anymore sadly. "

It happened after I used Panoxyl for my pimples. I ended up having a “red nose” and I always get bullied because of that. I was worried that it might be Rosacea. Luckily, I ended up on this site and tried this product because of the many reviews I have read. All these years of having this issue finally ended after using this essence. I paired it with Missha Pore Minimizing Toner but i can tell that this snail mucin really helped me with my problem. The result wasn’t instant but after a few weeks of use, I finally said goodbye to my “red nose”. This is my first bottle that I bought around August and I only used like not even a quarter of it. Thank you very much Soko Glam. will surely purchase it again and again. ♥️ "

I use about 3 pumps and pat it on in the AM and PM. This stuff makes me look well rested and it has made my skintone even. After about 3 weeks of this product, I don't even wear foundation or BB cream any more. I have combination skin and while it doesn't do much for the oil on my nose (that has stayed the same), it has really hydrated the dry parts of my face like forehead, cheeks and chin. It's also faded some older acne scars. I love this stuff! "

I loved how my skin seemed to drink it up but the day after I started using it I woke up with my skin feeling very tight and uncomfortable. I thought it would get better, instead every day it got worse. My skin felt tighter and drier, the skin on my already dry cheeks started to look even more dehydrated and some spots on my cheeks was so dry it was wrinkled/shriveled looking. I did my weekly blackhead extractions and put this essence on my skin afterwards because I read it was supposed to be soothing. Instead my skin the next day was completely raw on those spots, like this essence burned my skin almost as if I had applied an acid to it. It was upsettingly very irritating instead of soothing. My skin felt hot and irritated and I started developing lasting redness all over. Then I started getting little bumps and some flakiness where I've never had it before. The glowy skin I had achieved with my other Korean skin care was now dehydrated & dull, red and irritated and my pores were starting to get larger. It just got worse and worse everyday, I had to stop after only 6 days of use. I'm not sure why I had this reaction since I don't have sensitive skin but, luckily sokoglam has a great return policy!

I noticed that my skin felt dry and tight after going outside because of the high wind and cold weather (I live in New York). After using this, it has improved significantly. It is very sticky and thick so it stays on the skin, it does leave your skin feeling sticky even after 30 minutes. I've only been using it for a few months so I'm not sure how it's helped my overall complexion or acne scars but in terms of keeping my face hydrated, it definitely works! "

Nothing else in my skincare changed, so I tried to reintroduce it a few more times and sadly it causes me to breakout. I still think this is a great product and would recommend it.

At first, I had used one pump as a serum as an addition to my routine. This product was the kbeauty product that brought me even deeper into the kbeauty world, leading me to scroll endlessly on the Soko Glam website and checking what other things I could add into my ever-growing collection. This past summer, my boyfriend created his own skincare regime after seeing me take intentional care of my skin. He got interested in using snail mucin after being persuaded that it helps skin to rejuvenate itself through acne scar healing (and overall complexion). After he using it for couple months, his acne scars have faded a bit and his skin looks brighter.  "

I recently was able to use this on some seriously rough patches and it didn't sting at all to apply and really allowed me to hydrate that area and my whole face without irritating it or breaking it out. On my super dry patches I applied two layers. Because this is thicker if I am layering essences this is my second layer. It isn't too thick or goopy and to me it doesn't have a smell.

I used to wear it only at night because I thought it was too sticky to wear under makeup, but it turns out that following its application with a jade roller allows for a smooth palette. Such was the case for me, anyway! It has also worked very well for me as an eye gel. The instructions on the package suggest that you lightly tap it into the skin around the eyes like you're playing the piano. Out of curiosity, I started using this in place of my usual eye cream. I didn't have high expectations since it's not advertised as an eye treatment, although it very much is. This one is a keeper. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Elizabeth M., On My 4th Bottle! ," I've been using the Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence since I first started my K-beauty journey a year ago. Every once in a while I'll try a new essence, but this is the only one that never breaks me out, and always keeps my face nice and hydrated. The bottle lasts for FOREVER, and 1 pump gives you enough essence for my whole face. I used to order this from Amazon but after some disastrous fake product scams, I only order my K-beauty from Soko Glam or Peach and Lily. Soko Glam has the best customer service by far though, and the prices are waaaaay more in my range so I don't feel guilty about experimenting with new products. TL;DR: BUY THIS ESSENCE, AND SOKO GLAM IS THE BOMB. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Anika, I love it , It doesn't really have a smell. Which I think is great because I was scared it was gonna have a snail smell. It feels a little slimy and sinks into the skin very easily. My breakouts heal much faster and the scars/discoloration is fading. I've been using this for almost a month and you can hardly see the scars.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Catherine D., Great moisturizer ," Hydrates my sensitive oily skin really well without being too thick, greasy, or irritating. I've noticed my skin producing less sebum than before I started using this. I'm still oily, but my skin has more of a glowing look to it than oil slick. I will definitely repurchase this when I run out. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Geremy, Must Have ," This is one of my favorite COSRX products that I continually use and stock-up on. It's soothing, hydrating, and doesn't irritate my skin (combination skin type here). I use 3-5 pumps morning + night and find that this little bottle goes a long way. If you do a 5 or 10 step skincare routine, the essence really feels like a great hydrating barrier for your skin. I highly recommend! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Shelli S., Clear new acne in one night ," I am already in love with my new essence. The first night I tried it I had some small, new acne starting to form. I added this to my routine and woke up to clear skin. Snail for the win! It was alot thicker than I thought it was going to be. More of a serum than an essence but that didn't really matter to me. My skin felt fresh and light. This didn't cause a heavy moisturized feeling. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Jules, Don't understand the hype ," I have oily skin and deal with occasional hormonal pimples and zits and some hyperpigmentation. I've used this for 3 weeks and didn't see much of a difference. This did however moisturize my skin and made it feel plump. But in terms of lightening my scars like some people mentioned, I did not experience any of that. I may repurchase only because it has good ingredients and does a good job of moisturizing my skin. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Maria J., I don't think its necessary ," I've used this product for about two continuous months and I still can't figure out what its supposed to do. I don't see a difference in my skin when I put it on, after, or over the month. It takes quite a bit to cover my face and since I've been using it for a while and haven't seen a difference I skip this step now. It's just living in my drawer not getting used. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Saira, Alright ," The product is alright. Very subpar. If you have oily skin, make sure to only use 1/4 or 1/2 a pump because it really can enhance your oiliness and leave your face feeling extremely heavy and clogged if you use more than that. I bought this product in hopes it would fade scars from hyperpigmentation and I am still working on seeing the results. I might continue to buy the product solely because of the hyperpigmentation scar selling point. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Josie S., Not for me ," I bought this product because snail mucin is supposed to help with acne. At first it was fine, didn't burn or sting or seen to have an allergic reaction to it.

B., Holy Grail ," This review comes direct from my very reactive, itchy, redness -prone nose that gets painfully dry and flaky when I try putting products on it that it just does not like. My nose has been a problem area for me for a long time. My sister bought the snail 96 for herself and gave me a week's worth for me to try. Seriously, after my first day, the itchy redness around my nose disappeared and this is pretty much the only thing that has calmed it down. Thank you, snails, for being the thing I never knew my skin needed. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Aniqa S., Awesome! , I'm finally on the snail bandwagon with this essence and I'm loving every moment I use it!

A true staple. , I got this as a sample in my ipsy and honestly at first I was not a fan because I had no clue about any skincare steps I needed to take. I thought it was weird and just set it aside. Once I learned more I started using it after the Beauty Water toner and I'm obsessed! I cannot live without it my skin always feels so amazing after using it 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Nicole M., Love it! ," I absolutely love this snail mucin essence! A little goes a loooong way and it absorbs so quickly. One little pump is good enough for my entire face and neck! Since using this my face is less oily, breaks out less, and seems brighter. I’m on my second bottle and see myself buying a third in the future. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Gladys R., It’s worth a try :) ," At first, I was pairing this with a vitamin C serum but I was see no change in my skin whatsoever. I think because the 2 are highly concentrated, they were stopping each other from doing their jobs. I stopped pairing the 2 together and only using the snail mucin and that’s when I started seeing results! I have hyperpigmentation and after using the snail mucin, I’ve been seeing it slowly going away. I decided to buy this essence because I watched a lot of different YouTubers claiming that it’s very good and works overnight. I can say, at least for my skin, it doesn’t exactly work overnight, but I do have very damaged, scarred, oily and acne prone skin, so any improvement is very good. I’m definitely going to keep using it because I do see an improvement. if you are very oily like me, another thing that helps is the Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel for oily skin. This keeps away the oil build up, which keeps away the acne build up, which allows the snail mucin to reach it’s full repairing potential. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Caresse N.," Unfortunately, it broke me out. "," I understand that everyone's not the same, especially taking care of the skin. I wanted to try this one because the description stated that it helps with hyper-pigmentation and also hydration. However, I realize that sometimes(usually) when I try to use this product, I would always get an acne the next day. I did try for not using it for a week, then return it back to my routine AND being consistently using it to overcome the sensitivity on my skin. Yet, it did not work for me. I also bought this since it was cheap product for an Essence. I now realize this was NOT for ME :) I would go back to Neogen fermented micro essence, even if its a bit pricy. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Heather, Don't Understand the Hype ," When I decided to try a 10-step skincare routine, this was the first essence I bought because of its price and the great reviews. I used this for almost 5 months 1-2 times a day and I really don't get what the big deal is with this stuff. It didn't make my skin feel particularly hydrated, it didn't help with discoloration or evening tone, and it didn't help my heal current breakouts. Honestly, I only used it for so long because I didn't know what else to get and it didn't do any harm, but I should have switched ages ago. As your first essence it's not bad but if you want real results, try something else. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Laura A., Unfortunately it's a no from me ," After reading all the amazing reviews on this product, I was so excited to give it a try.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,KAYLA, So far so good! ," I first saw snail mucin in a sheet mask years ago as was really grossed out at the idea but the more I've read about the benefits, it seems like the perfect ingredient for my post-acne hyperpigmentation and combination (oily/sensitive) skin. So this is my first time using it and it's also the first essence I have used. I'm loving how soft and hydrated it makes my skin feel and it's really helped cut down on my oil production. That said the one negative I've noticed which might be correlated is an increase in blackheads recently, but I'm willing to stick it out and see if it lasts and I still see an overall improvement with my scarring. It goes on a little sticky but absorbs really well when you press it in, I find that one pump is enough for my entire face and a little down my neck. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Taylor, Good Essence , A little goes a long way with this product. I have been using it for a month and I have barely made a dent in it.

I just started the routine so I am still trying to find what works best for me. So far this has been a good product.

I honestly haven't really noticed it doing anything. Not harming it, but not making a huge difference in terms of hydration either. It is very light, cool, and isn't irritating, which is great, as my skin is very sensitive. But I don't think it's enough for my dry skin. It's okay enough for me to keep using it, but I won't be repurchasing this product.  "

I am almost 70 years young "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Kate A., Great ," This is a great product. Highly moisturizing but light not tacky, easily absorbs. Just like halyronic acid. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Melissa S., A Slime You Can Get Behind ," For my first essence ever, I really really like it. I'd probably give it a 4.5 vs a 5 though since I'm not sure if I notice any major changes in my complexion in regards to hyper-pigmentation. The consistency is like a gooey slime that takes a little bit to get used to, but it glides on easily and quickly absorbs. It's a total bargain given about 1/2-1 pump can cover your whole, it's only $19, and lasts forever! I've found it super useful, not just in daily use, but as an additional layer when my skin is feeling parched or having some issue. Will definitely be repurchasing this! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Val B., My Skin Is Bouncy ," I am just a touch unsure how much difference this is making, but I think it's helping hydrate my skin. I haven't experimented with stopping to see if my skin misses it, but I like it so far. Warning - this product is VERY THICK. When I put it on my skin, I have to be careful not to go directly from my cheeks to forehead because it will trail and fall in my eye (ouch!) lol. I'm really a fan of CosRx! "

I'm fighting cystic acne on my neck and chin area, as well as hormonal and stress breakouts. However I have been using this product for almost 2 months and I can honestly say that it has made a difference. My breakouts are less severe and my acne scars heal within a few days. When I first started using it, it didn't break me out or anything which was nice since I have sensitive skin. It also last a pretty long time. I'm barely at half a bottle, and I use it twice a day. This product is now a staple of my skincare routine. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Bianca C., Great Essence for the Price! , I think at only $19 this is a steal and a great bargain essence! I have issues with mild acne on the sides of my face and when I apply this during my nighttime routine I notice in the morning the acne has gone done and is less red/swollen. I can't say that it's reducing or stopping the acne altogether so that's a bummer. :(

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Aja J.," So Far, So Good "," I have very sensitive skin and will typically break out immediately if my skin does not agree with one of the ingredients. Naturally, I was skeptical about this product but as I'm on my journey for a new skin routine as I age, I figured why not. I have not been disappointed. I have definitely noticed my skin staying more hydrated in my cold climate and dry surroundings when I'm inside. I haven't seen an immediate clearing up of some of my blemishes from hormonal acne but I'm hopeful. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Christy, wonderful product ," I have been using this for about a week and I have seen such a great improvement in my skin. My acne scars are less visible and my skin is smoother and has better texture. The product is scent-free which I appreciated and I enjoyed the interesting texture. The only con for me is that it's sometimes difficult for me to apply. The texture is a little slimy so when I am trying to apply it to my face, strands of the essence drips across my face and gets into my mouth sometimes. Despite this small inconvenience, this is my favorite essence of the many that I have tried. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Sarah D., So-So essence ," I tried this toner because of the great reviews; however, while this essence is very hydrating and soothing, it caused breakouts on my face and a slight rash the first time I used it. To be fair, my skin is very sensitive and on the oily side so most products cause me to breakout. I gave it a few more tries and did not have a rash, but breakouts continued to occur until I stopped using this product. I will give this product to someone with drier skin. 5 out of 5 stars for sokoglam's costumer service though! "

I have been using this product 2x a day for about 3 weeks now, after the first week or so I noticed a more even skin tone. This is probably my favorite product of the ones I ordered, my skin is soft and not dry. The only complaint I have is that it takes a little longer to absorb into my skin than I'd like.

Back in the days I was not into any type of skincare routine at all so I was just using the mucin after the most basic face cleanse one can do and it was so effective my skin became spots free after several weeks! Now after years, I had completely forgot about that active and I rediscovered it with Soko Glam, needless to say I put it rank one as the most important step in my Korean SC routine (what I mean is, among all the steps this one is my favorite) ! I just love this product, from the texture to the results. It's slimy, odorless and colorless, very pleasant to apply and penetrates very fast.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Aezat A., I'm not sure. , I've been using this snail mucin for almost a month I guess? So here are my thoughts... 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Courtney B., Third time’s the charm! , 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Penelope S., Serum ,What can I say is that I'm not exactly sure if it does make any changes on my skin. I don't see any differences or changes in my skin texture or etc. I use triple C lightning liquid too so I don't know if one of those overshadow one another. But I don't see any changes of using this snail mucin even tho I heard so many good reviews. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Allie C., Worked Great at First ," This is the third essence I’ve tried and ultimately it’s the last one I put in before layering my serums. Living in Denver, Colorado we deal with high altitude, dry climate, close proximity to the sun and I have bought almost every product to combat dryness and wrinkles. This seems to be the last key ingredient to combat winter dryness and the very small wrinkle creeping up on my forehead. If you’re considering buying this, please do so. I can’t imagine my routine without it now. Love, Love, LOVE this essence. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Jenna T., Very pleasantly surprised! ," I was a bit skeptical of this when I squirted a bit on my fingers as it feels a bit sticky but it absorbs really well and quickly, and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. I'm not sure if it's the combination of all the products I've used in the last 5 days (that's how long I've been doing the 10 step) but even after 1 day, my face was brighter and softer. And after 5 days my face appears more even, breakouts are fading, getting fewer new pimples, and the random dry spots amongst the acne spots are gone. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Anja H., Good! ," This product has definitely kept my redness in check as well as softened up the skin. Seems like the few pimples I get are smaller and go away faster. Doesnt go on greasy and absorbs fast, you seriously need a TINY bit of this stuff. Leaves me a little shiny but I dont mind since I use it at night anyway. 4 stars because the difference is there however not dramatic, also because of the slight sheen. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Sara, Made me breakout ," At first I loved this essence. It absorbed quickly, seemed to calm any redness, and left my face extremely soft. Unfortunately, I suffered two really bad breakouts back to back while using it. At first, I didn't attribute it to this product since it seemed so gentle and calming, but after the second breakout, I realized this essence was the only change to my skincare routine and stopped using it. My skin has healed quickly and hasn't broken out since. I'm really disappointed, but it's obviously not a good fit for me. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Darylyn R., Good ," I like how it is quickly consumed by the skin, im oily skin and it does not make my skin oily at all. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Shivaun P., My first essence! ," I read that snail mucin was very good for redness, which I have trouble with - mostly from dry weather or other skin products. This is very gooey and kind of sticky (a string of it connects my hands together sometimes when I massage a bit between my palms before applying). I found doing this is easier to apply than tapping it on. Once spread across my face, then I massage in. It feels kind of tingly, but not in an irritating way, it actually helps a bit with the redness. I'm not entirely sure how hard it works, since everything else in my routine is pretty hydrating, but I have no adverse reactions, and the price is low enough to still get it when trying out essences.

At first I was a bit sceptical since I was worried that I could get an allergic reaction, but thankfully that wasn't the case. It really help deal with the cystic acne I had. I usually use it at night, but sometimes I use it as a spot treatment for the daytime. "

I initially received this product in my ipsy bag and it is the product that changed my entire skin care regime. When I went to Soko Glam to by a full bottle, I discovered Charlotte’s 10-step skin care routine and after trying the routine for two weeks, I already see a marked improvement in my skin! As I reach the half century mark in a few months, I am so grateful to have found Soko Glam! "

The texture is heavier than water essence, but it is essentially slime. It absorbed relatively quickly. I was able to layer it with my vitamine C sérum and the million other steps that I use seamlessly. Would buy again, but I recommend having a water essence as well as the snail essence. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Emily, Great product , This product hydrates my skin without inflaming it. I have the early stages of rosacea and this does not aggravate my sensitive skin. It is also really affordable and lasts a long time which is a plus. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lorynn H., I adore this essence ," I got this and use it with the Triple C Lightning Serum...saw a difference in my acne scar overnight. With consistent use for a week, the scar is almost gone! It’s been a huge help in my skincare journey, I and I’ll certainly be purchasing it again. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,KDerosa, GRRRRRRUH! ," I brought this because I thought that my skin could use a little boost for an upcoming family event. I have a pretty ""plane jane"" skin routine that works pretty well. I thought that this product would take me to the next level based on the reviews. But it didn't. It broke me out horribly and I had to go to my event with a rash on my face. The rash has started to subside, and now I have acne scars in the middle of my face. My skin was clear before I started using this. I'm absolutely heart broken and furious. All I had was some mild hyper pigmentation from old fading acne scars, now I have new scars. :-( "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Jessica L., visible difference ," I love this essence! the first time I used it, I felt my face looked and seemed a lot more plump and the acne I had was way less irritated and red! great value & the formula is so fun to use.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lp, Great product! ," Of my arsenal, this product may be the best. I use it daily before bed and am glowing the next morning :) I'm in Montana where it is dry so this is particularly helpful. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Molly Q., Fantastic for Acne Scars! , I initially tried this because it was in my ipsy bag but I am so glad I did because I probably never would have purchased any essence before this. I feel like it really does help make a difference when I use it before the serum & moisturizer. Like it really helps lock in the moisture or it’s a good prep. I still don’t understand what essences are but I can tell it’s made a difference in my skin. This may be a confusing review but the point is that this is great! I even waited to hear when it was back in stock to buy the full size. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Christina C., Definite HG status!! ," I bought this product in hopes that it would help clear my face and shoulder acne, and it did so much more!

I never write reviews but this stuff needed a recommendation! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Kimberly, LOVE! ," I just purchased my second bottle of this and will definitely keep purchasing! :) I love the consistency of this product and it was a surprisingly moisturizing essence, without lingering on my skin in an oily way.

If it had to be one product to purchase out of all the B beauty products for beginners, I will definitely state this has to be the one!! The texture is amazing on your skin and it creates a nice canvas for the days I decide to wear makeup. BEST ESSENCE I have yet to try! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Bran, BEST EVER , You guys!!! I've honestly NEVER written a review before. I received this as a sample in one of my beauty subscriptions and will definitely be purchasing a larger size when it's back in stock. This has made my skin look amazing in only a week. It has made my complexion look more even and made my skin feel incredibly soft. Definitely recommend!!! 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Mai C., Great Hydration for oily skin , I have combo to oily skin. I notice that the excess oils/ sebum on my face is due to lack of moisturizing. I've been using this for about 2 months and it has lasted me a long time. A little goes a long way. I can not live without this. This makes a difference in my skin care routine and I don't get as oily or shiny by the end of the day like I usually would. Since doing the Korean skin care routine I've had less breakouts. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Nina, Quality and Affordability ," I am trying to deal with some hyperpigmentation, so this serum was a logical choice. But the texture had me worried; it's fairly thick and tacky, and I thought it would cause breakouts, but I use it every day and it's absolutely lovely. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Stephanie B., Allergic Reaction ," Unfortunately this product didn't work for me and caused a painful allergic reaction. Oddly I have used other snail products with no problems, guess this one just didn't agree with me. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Tran L., Essential Items For My Skincare Routine! ," Absolutely love this essence! I have oily, acne prone skin and this CosRx Snail Mucin Essence has helped me a lot! It is very lightweight, non sticky and nourishing for my skin. Sometimes during hot summer days, I used it with moisturizer only, skipping the serum. This essence has helped me reduce my redness from acne very well! Needing another bottle soon! Just waiting for it to be restocked. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Jina R., Moisturizing! ," This is a really lovely essence, especially for the price. I use a few pumps and my face feels so happy! Very moisturizing, but not at all in a lingering or oily way. Would recommend it! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Clarice, Would Buy Again!! ," I wanted to try this sooner, but it was out of stock, and I can understand why!! I was very impressed! It's got an almost sticky consistency when dispensed, little to no smell, but it absorbs quickly into the skin. I really think its made a difference in my face once I started using it, my skin gets nice and clear when I don't have hormone breakouts, but even then those dont last long and it doesn't agitate my acne and make it worse. It feels nice to apply and since it absorbs quick, doesnt feel sticky at all for very long. I bought this two months ago, and I was worried that it wouldnt last long because the bottle is smaller than i thought, but a little goes a long ways as theres still over 3/4's left in the bottle. Once this bottle is empty I would definitely buy again!! :^> "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lyndsay H., A Pleasant Surprise ," As an American used to very different ideas of skincare, I was reluctant and admittedly a little grossed out at the the prospect of putting snail anything on my face. But I was also a little curious so I took the plunge and purchased. I was really surprised to find that the product has no smell, no sliminess - nothing that would be a turn off or stop me in my tracks from slapping this (not literally) all over my face. So I did just that. And I was surprised again in the morning over the next few days to realize that my blemishes seemed to calm down a lot. I can't say this gets rid of my outbreaks but it definitely feels like it soothes and aids in repairing, and for that alone, I'm grateful I gave this a shot. Now I hope I don't run across snails in my everyday life because I think I'll be tempted to just, like, rub them all over my face for 100% snail power... "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Charlene L., Great for brightening , I love this essence. It moisturizes and brightening my skin. I use this twice a day and everyday. I think this helps with my sun spots and acne scaring. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Alicja W., Combination and dehydrated skin problem with hormonal acne ," I bought it to see if essence is good, because I never use in my life. After 2-3 days I have noticed differences. Super regenerates the skin, reduces slowly acne scars, skin feels great, doesn't stink, lightweight formula, absorbs quickly. Yes, I buy this next time, I highly recommend it. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Carmelle, Power Packed Hyrdation ," This product is incredibly hydrating. And it goes a long way. At first, one pump seems to only distribute a small amount, but believe me, that's plenty for your face. The consistency is a little thinner, but it spreads evenly, and isn't too sticky afterward. It also delivers noticeable hydration right away, with an overall bouncy 'chok chok' feeling with continued use. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Becca, Helps skin retain moisture! ," I've been using this daily for about 2 weeks and I've definitely seen an improvement in the brightness and pigmentation in my skin.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lindsay J., I have only used this , I have only used this a few times... so far so good. It's a little stickier than previous snail products I've used in the past.

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Kara P., Game changer ," I'm relatively new to the Korean skincare routine, but after researching it a bit I decided that the first product to try would be this essence as I didn't really have a Western product equivalent. I was a little nervous to put snail goo on my face, but the internet practically sings its praises - there's a reason that I'm trying out the Korean skincare routine, so hey, what do I have to lose? It has been about 2 weeks and so far this product hasn't disappointed me. I have super oily skin (seriously, I live in Florida and could fry an egg on my face between the oil that my skin produces and the death heat rays), but this hydrates without furthering any oiliness or shine. I've noticed that my skin is much softer and brighter than before (though I do have residual acne scars and hyperpigmentation that I'm working on with other products). The only caveat to this product is the consistency: it has the feel you would expect from snail goo and can be very tacky and slimy. Not going to lie, it freaked me out a little at first, but I'll overlook it if it means any improvement in my skin. Overall, I'd recommend this product and will likely repurchase when I run out. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Reggie R., good one , I like better than my moisturizer. It leaves my skin soft and helps with my acne. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lisa Z., Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ," I was so skeptical about using snail trail on my skin but I'm so happy I did. I had over exfoliated my skin with actives and using dr g brightening peel, a physical exfoliator damaged my skin barrier. I used this essence and very gentle products and moisturizers while waiting for it to heal. The Essence helped to heal faster and made skin stronger in just 3 weeks! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Veronica H.," Great for sensitive acne-prone, dry or oily "," I have incredibly acne-prone, sensitive skin and this product doesn't irritate in the slightest, or break me out. No odor. I bought this bc of all the talk of snail essence healing acne scars but after 2 weeks I can't say I see it. I'm still impressed by the fact it's silicone-free product, that's a rare treasure (silicones cause acne). I'm oily but this feels like silk so it's probably great for dry skin too. If you've got the cash definitely try it though!! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lily P., I've been using this with , I've been using this with the vitamin c and saw a huge difference in my acne scar! The consistency is a little weird but I am loving the results !

I have seen such a difference in my skin since using it. I have super sensitive and acne prone skin and it allows my skin to heal so quickly! The texture is not very watery, its very smooth, but not sticky at all. Its sort of gel-like. I love how my skin feels after using this product. I would highly recommend. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Allison, love the feel , Perfect summer moisturizer to wear under sunscreen. It's so light and soaks into my skin immediately and completely. I am prone to breakouts but so far so good. I would definitely recommend this product! 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Celine G., Holy Grail ," This is an absolutely fantastic essence. I have dry skin and am sensitive to scented products, and this hydrates like nothing else and has no scent. It's perfect. I'll never buy another snail essence as long as CosRX keeps making this one! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Courtney D., Good Product ," I use this product in conjunction with Oil-Free Moisturizing Lotion with Birch Sap. They were the first two products I bought. Idk which product is doing what to my skin but I do like them both. I've noticed significant improvement on the right side of my face with regards to reducing acne and melanin marks. They haven't completely disappeared but they are alot better. However, the left side of my face is still suffering from hormonal acne and they are taking a very long time to go away. If you know anything about hormonal acne, you know that whichever side of your face is breaking out is the side of your ovaries that is ovulating. I've also noticed that I've broken out more with more ""normal"" pimples than I usually do. But I've read that your skin may be getting rid of gunk and that may be causing pimples. I'm hoping with continued use, all the acne will get much better. I really like how well the products absorb and smell. I have not had any negative reaction to these but I also do not have sensitive skin. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Anna G., Skin Like Silk ," This power essence is where it's at, guys. I have tried a couple different types of essences before buying this one. All were nice, but this one is actually showing results. Since I have been using it (for about 4 weeks now), I have noticed that my skin is smooth as silk and has a wonderful glow. My acne is also healing A LOT quicker and not leaving the dark red spots that usually plague my face. All in all, this is a great product that is worth the purchase. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Kaylah, I WIll Buy This Until They Don't Sell It ," I've been using this for a little over a month now and I have seen TREMENDOUS improvements in my overall skin health. It feels softer, it retains moisture better, and the number and intensity of my breakouts has dropped from a new blemish every week, to once in a blue moon. I will say that a little goes a long way; I use one pump for my face and my neck and that seems to do fine. I love this essence and I will continue to incorporate it into my routine until they don't make it anymore. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Eihing Z., Wonderful!!! ," I initially used snail mucin in the past in samples from face shop and it made my skin feel very sensitive so I was hesitant to try this. I was struggling with hormonal acne around my chin and under my jawline. This product was recommended to me by the consultant along with the skinfood tea tree oil foaming cleanser. After using it the first night, I woke up and my skin looked brighter. The following few days, my skin looked a lot better, felt better, and more importantly my acne calmed down. Now I have scars left and the snail mucin is helping make them fade. This also moisturizer my skin without making me oily or break out. I'm in love with this product! It is also my first product from soko glam! Will definitely be repurchasing! 😍 "

I never thought I would have such smooth and soft skin, but as soon as I added this into my skin care routine I began to feel the results. I don't even wear foundation anymore. Just a light BB cream. Even then, I don't have to wear it every day. My complexion has evened out so much and looks so radiant because of this.

I have been struggling with hormonal acne and dry patches, and since I have been using I haven't had any dry patches but the acne comes and goes. I also have very sensitive skin, and this does not feel irritating. It just feels like the essence is an extra hydrating step, and could probably replace a hydrating serum during the warmer months.

Unfortunately I'll be passing this on to a friend to try instead. "

After a few weeks of use, there is a noticeable difference in how smooth and soft my skin is. I was definitely skeptical about how it's supposed to help with breakouts but that has also proven to be true! This helps my small breakouts fade away in a few days instead of a week or longer.

While it wasn't extraordinarily hydrating (for someone with dry damaged skin) it did slightly reduce the premature fine lines around my eyes. More impressive however was how when an oil cleanser gave me a massive breakout, this product could quickly sooth my cystic acne into submission. Seriously, as fast as anything could rise up, this product would gentle work it back down again. I'm going to move onto other products to target fine lines, PIH and dehydration, but this? I will ALWAYS keep a bottle of this on hand now for how soothing and healing it is on irritated skin. An amazing product everyone should have in their arsenal! "

Now I usually will get only one pimple, but now thats even less frequent, plus the size of the pimple is smaller too. The great thing I love about this product too is that, what ever pimple I do get, I feel it span of time I have it has drastically shortened. I used to get a pimple or two and they would be there the whole week and then sort of a leave a dark mark for another 3 to 5 days. This product though has made it though that when I do get a pimple it last like 2 to 3 days tops and the mark that is left from the pimple is gone within another 2 to 3 days. So basically with a week, it is totally gone. As you can tell I already love this product for my occasional blemish, but it is also very hydrating to my skin with all of it nutrients and leaves it feeling super soft. Now if I had some advise for future users its that, yes, the product is really slimy, but I got over it in a day. Also, a little of this product really does go a long way because of how thick it is. I usually do two pumps and pat/spread over my face and neck. It does leave a slight tacky finish, but that goes away in a minute as it is absorbed. I am really happy I found this product. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lora, Magic Stuff! , I've only been using this product for about 4 days and already have noticed a difference in my skin! The tiny blackhead bumps around hairline are practically gone and my skin is much softer! Looking forward to watching it get better and better! 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Marygian B.," Dewy, tight looking skin "," My face was a little bumpy due to blackheads on my cheeks and nose. I decided to try COS RX when I found out my previous essence (Missha) tested on animals. It keeps my skin tight, and really dewy (shiny/fresh looking) without an oily feeling at all! It got rid of all the blackheads on my nose, but I gave it four stars since it's been a few weeks and no improvement on my cheeks. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Miska, Allergic reaction ," I do believe I am allergic to snail! Upon my first use, my face began to burn and itch within minutes of application. I developed a red painful itchy rash all over my face where I had applied the product. This was the only change in my facial routine so I know it's the culprit. I was excited to try out a snail product too. Just goes to show what works for one person may be a nightmare to another. I kick myself for not spot testing first. There are very few ingredients in this essence, who would think it would do this to my face?! Minimal ingredients drew me to Cosrx too! On the search for another essence/serum. Five stars for the customer service (thank you Olivia!) and Sokoglam's awesome return policy. Guess that I'm just one of those sensative gals that needs to test out any new products carefully. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Alexandra H., Amazing for those of you with acne ," Obsessed with this essence! Since I started using snail musin on my skin, my acne and redness has completely cleared up and it is very sensitive on the skin so does not irritate. Have already bought a back up, highly recommend. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Lauren P.," Super hydrating, lightweight "," Big fan! My only complaint is that even after almost 3 months of consistent use, my hyperpigmentation remains pretty unaffected. Otherwise, very satisfied with this, make my skin feel soft and dewy. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Katrina, LOVE THIS! ," This product is amazing! It leaves my skin feeling smooth, and has been extremely calming to my oily/acne-prone skin. Reduction in breakouts and dark spots since using this 2xs a day for almost a month now. Will definitely recommend this product and repurchase! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Madeline B., Just as good as anticipated ," I continue to be a huge fan of COSRX and their acne-prone-skin friendly products. This is the essence I use when I think my skin needs a little bit of an extra boost, and it works well for the whole face, though it's best to use other products close to eyes. The texture is very viscous so it can take a bit of product to adequately cover your face. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Allyson A., Disappointed , I had heard great things about snail mucin so I was excited to try this. I have been using it regularly for 3 weeks. I've seen no improvement or benefit for my skin with this product. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Selene L., Light Moisture ," Smells nice, goes on smooth, not sticky. Absorbs well and quickly. I have somewhat oily skin mostly in T-zone. Works for me as a light moisturizer (has sodium hyaluronate!). I have pretty clear skin, so is the snail mucin working? Who knows.... "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Ae C., LOVE it. ," I've been using this every night for several weeks, and I love it. It's hugely hydrating - my skin just sucks it up - and I can already see a marked difference in several areas of hyperpigmentation. In particular, I have two thumbnail-sized sunspots - one on either side of my face, high on my cheekbone(s), near my temple(s) - which I've specifically been targeting with the Snail 96, and I already see CLEAR improvement. It's a bit tough to describe, but the spots essentially look like they're breaking up and dissolving all around the edges. I anticipate that this effect will continue the longer I use the product. I use a different snail product (by Mizon) that I think is a bit better with my acne, but on the hydration and pigmentation fronts, the CosRx is an absolute winner. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Olivia S., Wow! ," It works like magic on healing acne scars and dark spots caused by pimples. I had a few brown spots on my nose and temples from past breakouts, and I noticed them fade quite a bit after three days of use in the morning and afternoon. After 5 days, they were pretty much completely gone! Normally they'd take weeks to go away. I also break out a lot, and it didn't clog any of my pores. Its lightly moisturizing and breathable, which I like! Will definitely buy again~ (Do keep in mind I was also using an Aloe Gel in the morning, an Aloe BHA toner, and a Teatree Cleanser, that may have helped too.) "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Tifanie L., Awesome , I love this product. It helps heal and clear your skin. Great for acne! 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Desiree O., LOVE ," My favorite sheet masks are the snail mucin ones so I decided to give this stuff a try and I LOVE it. It's one of those products that makes your skin go ""ahhhh"" when you put it on. I have super sensitive skin that's sort of always red and the snail music essence has helped the redness calm down. Highly recommend! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Isabel, Amazing results already!! ," When I saw this brand was targeted at people with acne, I HAD to have it! I bought most of the COSRX line as soon as I could. I was finding that although my other Korean products were great at things like texture correction and other stuff, I could really use a product that treated acne AND did all that great stuff too! "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Jennifer E., I braved the snail mucin ," I like the oil free moisture this product provides. And while I'm not totally sure about the accelerated cell turn over claim, I can say that I have noticed a reduction in my acne scars. "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Teresa, finally jumped on the snail bandwagon ," I've been using this product morning and night for the last 2 weeks and I'm pretty impressed. Too early to tell if it's helping with hyper-pigmentation, and I haven't noticed any effects on whether it helps or prevents acne, but my face is very smooth and supple. I've been using it as an essence at night, but as my moisturizer during the day. I have oily skin and its too heavy for me to layer a moisturizer on top of this during the day time. I do love that it is a lot of product for the price. Also, it's secretly kind of fun to tell people that snail mucin is what is making my face so smooth. Will wait till I finish the bottle to determine whether or not it really made enough of a difference in my complexion before deciding to repurchase. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Carol F., Wonderful addition to my skincare routine , Love the results using this followed by the Missha Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream. I have very sensitive skin and this has helped to keep my skin soft and hydrated without causing more redness. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Ivana C., Snail Mucin Magic ," I have normal/oily combination and acne prone skin. Since using the COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence, my face has felt soft, supple, and hydrated! I use about 1-1.5 pumps of the essence every day and night, and its more than enough for my face. I like how the product dispenses, and the consistency and very light scent is pleasant. Since my budget is very very tight, my regimen is just a water based face cleanser, gentle exfoliator, essence, and an spf moisturizer. Would love to try more products but so far so good... "

12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,CincyGirl, Great Product that lives up the hype! , I really like how you get a huge bottle for a reasonable price. This keeps my oil combo skin in check and I haven't experienced any breakout sine using this. The texture is slightly thicker than water. On my face if feels very moisturizing but at the same time I feel like it helps with the oil control. Very happy with this and look forward to trying more products in COSRX. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Mia S., would rate it higher if i could ," As soon as I saw that this brand had become available on Soko Glam, I rushed to buy as many of its products as I could. "
