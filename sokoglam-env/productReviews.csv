170715665, On Calming serum : Green tea + Panthenol ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," Oh, wow. I am absolutely in love with this serum. So, so calming and soothing and really helps to reduce my redness. "
170715665, On Calming serum : Green tea + Panthenol ,Rachel W.,Sensitive,35-44, Works great on my sensitive and red skin! 
170715665, On Calming serum : Green tea + Panthenol ,Aswan,Normal,45-55, My skin is acne prone and this product helps a lot in calming my skin. it helps a lot around that time of the month when the skin is irritated . I have seen very positive results when using it. 
170715665, On Calming serum : Green tea + Panthenol ,Kev,Combination,18-24, When my skin is very sensitive I tried this product. I don't use it often just when I notice my skin has a little more redness and irritation so usually around summer time. It reduced my redness and irritation by a lot and before I knew it my skin felt like it went back to normal. I keep this with me all the time just in case I need my skin to relax! 
170715665, On Calming serum : Green tea + Panthenol ,Mishal D.,Combination,35-44, I have nothing overwhelmingly positive to say about this product. Doesn't feel like it's doing anything. 
457623832, On Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask ,Autumn R.,Dry,25-35, A great mask for calming the skin. Does just what it says! 
457623832, On Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask ,nikki m.,Dry,18-24, Good for sensitive skin 
457623832, On Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask ,Vanessa R.,Dry,>55, I like the way this sheet mask feels on my skin. 
457623832, On Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask ,Mar O.,18-24, No,My skin feels soft 
457623832, On Pure Fit Cica Calming True Sheet Mask ,Anchi, No,Dull/Uneven Skin, Calms any redness and irritated I have 
466817919, On Retinol Expert 0.1% ,Tristan,Combination,18-24," Before I start the guts of my review, I should preface that I am 24 years old, with acne prone and combination skin. My skin is not very sensitive, and I did not use this product in my face, and I use prescription adapalene gel for my acne and I was sent this product free in an exchange for a review by Sokoglam. "
466817919, On Retinol Expert 0.1% ,Claire,Sensitive,25-35,"Now, I used this product on my neck nightly since first getting this product. Now, I normally wouldn’t use a retinal right away nightly, and I would space out and ladder up my applications in time, but since I carry most of my skin care down to my neck, I felt comfortable with the frequent application. I find the product itself to be thicker than expected, but easily spreadable. It had a yellow hue and an interesting scent to it, but it is not unpleasant. I like to use this before I put my normal moisturizer over my neck. I’m the two month since using this product, I have noticed a reduction in hyperpigmentation from past acne and the fading of past acne scars. I find this product mixes well with most of my other skin care products, other than certain actives, like BHA. (I would not normally recommend or use Retinal or BHA together in a routine, but for the sake of the review I did for a few times) I would recommend this product for someone looking for a low irritating retinal that pairs well with other products. I will say though, for the price, as much as I like it, I probably won’t repurchase in the future in addition to the Rx Retinoid I currently use. If you have the change, and want to try this product, I would recommend this product for you, as I’ve seen results in a short period of time. "
466817919, On Retinol Expert 0.1% ,Sun M.,Combination,55+, This is my 2nd retinol and it is so effective. It seems my wrinkles are getting faded. 
466822879, On Bio Conditioning Essence ,Sun M.,Combination,55+, This product 100% helps my skin feel smoother and brighter. I cannot recommend this product enough. 
466822879, On Bio Conditioning Essence ,Alex,Combination,18-24," I use this product as a toner in the mornings and I love the way my skin feels afterward. Over time, my skin did feel smoother to the touch, so I couldn't recommend this product enough! "
33836506, On Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner ,Joleena M.,Sensitive,18-24, i have used this product before and let me just say… it is so good. i love it! super refreshing and brightening. my skin has lost its bumps and it’s oiliness. 
33836506, On Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner ,Mandy G.,Combination,35-44," It has a nice smell - kind of woodsy. It’s a good toner, I will most likely repurchase! Preps my skin for the serum and works well with my moisturizer. "
33836506, On Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner ,Minouche L.,Combination,35-44, It’s a little bit to strong for my skin after using it for about 2 weeks my skin got very irritated like burning sensation 
33836506, On Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner ,jinahluv,Sensitive,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
23356610, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original ,Kelley A.,Sensitive,25-35, Removes all makeup quite easily and leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped 
23356610, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original ,Kell A.,Oily,25-35," This product has a great texture that melts down to easily take off makeup with minimal rubbing. Waterproof mascara is the only product that takes a little more effort to remove, but still always fully comes off. "
23356610, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original ,Solveig,Combination,25-35," I got this as a trial at first and immediately knew I had to purchase the full product. The way it is light on your skin, yet removes what you need it to is quite impressive. To me, it has the faintest smell of apple peels which is pleasant and refreshing. This is definitely a staple item for me, and would like to try the other kinds as well. "
23356610, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original ,Vanessa R.,Dry,>55, Takes all my makeup off. 
23356610, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Original ,Camille,Sensitive,25-35,my skin is so soft. This product Preps my skin for Double cleansing. It makes my  
457623238, On Pure Fit Cica Cream Intense ,Rachel,35-44, No," I absolutely adore this cream, I need a LOT of hydration for my skin and this one does the job. It leave a light greasy feeling that is quite normal for this level of hydration but I don't mind, my skin thank me when I use it!!! "
457623238, On Pure Fit Cica Cream Intense ,Alina C., No,Other,I have Rosacea and Cosrx product really improved my control over it and give me nice skin. I need a lot of hydration! 
457623238, On Pure Fit Cica Cream Intense ,Natalia S.,Loss of Firmness,65+, I love this cream. it is rich and absorbs really well. 
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Jennifer S.,Sensitive,35-44," I have very reactive, sensitive skin along with melasma. I’ve been using this daily for two weeks. I now add it to my décolleté after my showers. I love this stuff. I’m already addicted. "
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Amy R.,Oily,25-35, I really like this essence. It absorbs well and my skin feels a more moisturized after using it. 
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Maria,Dry,35-44," I've been wanting to try this for awhile, and I'm so glad I finally got it! I only wish I started using it sooner. I feel like even with my acne scars that are taking a long time to fade, my skin still somehow is just so healthy looking since I've started using it. The bottle itself is so lovely to hold, I feel so fancy when I use it. Such a treat! "
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Alyssa,Normal,25-35," This made a noticeable difference in my acneic skin in a short amount of time, and it feels so luxurious. Fast absorbing, so that makes it easy to layer quickly under moisturizer or SPF. Love this stuff! "
174175617, On Soft Shield Pimple Patch ,Rachel C.,Combination,25-35," These work well. More importantly, the adhesive isn’t too strong where it hurts to remove the patch but strong enough to withstand water and sweat. "
174175617, On Soft Shield Pimple Patch ,Rachel,Dry,45-55, I never had acne as a teen. I just never did … but now at 49 (!) I find myself occasionally getting a pimple or two. (Why now??). I have purchased these a few times now. I really like them. They really work … and they are practically invisible. I actually forgot I was wearing one and actually went out in public. It just melted into my skin! I don’t think anyone noticed! I always like to keep a package on hand “just in case” … and the price is very affordable. 
174175617, On Soft Shield Pimple Patch ,Paola C.,Normal,25-35," I've tried several brands of pimple patches over the years (the same brands you're probably thinking of), but these are by far my favorite and most re-purchased. The beveled edges mean that they not only adhere to your skin better, but that they blend into any complexion or skin tone almost seamlessly. There are two different sized patches included, and the sheer number of patches (42 for just $6!) makes this product well worth your money; I use them liberally (as one should!) and don't feel guilty about it afterwards because they're so inexpensive. Using these patches at any and every stage of a pimple—when you first notice the blemish emerging, once you've picked at it, and once it has already started to scar—has helped my skin heal and get back to normal so much quicker. I cannot recommend this product enough!! "
174175617, On Soft Shield Pimple Patch ,Morgan D.,Combination,18-24, Got these on a whim and I absolutely love the double edge design! These really pull the gunk out of your face. 
174175617, On Soft Shield Pimple Patch ,Lily T.,Sensitive,18-24," These are great, everytime I remember to put them over emerging blemishes I wake up the next morning so grateful that I did. They’ll take a pimple from whitehead for gone in 8 hours sometimes. And even when they don’t it’s helpful for healing and to avoid picking at pimples. "
444408358, On Dewy Gloss ,Dragana T.,Dry,35-44, It’s nice moisturizing lip gloss and I like that it doesn’t have any fragrance but I still don’t think it’s worth the price. I bought it only to see what’s the hype. Nice packing. 
466827195, On PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum ,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35," Been using this serum for a few weeks and I’ll be honest- it’s definitely not an overnight game changer, but I do really like it. I definitely had to give it time to see how it works and personally I need more than the 4-5 drops. I use the whole dropper’s worth but I do think it had made a difference in the overall texture and look of my face. I think with the caffeine I do see less puffiness in my face as well. It goes on lightly and is not greasy which is nice and it doesn’t pill under any products I’ve used. Not sure I’ll buy again but I’m definitely going to finish the bottle! "
466827195, On PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum ,Jaime T.,Sensitive,35-44, This is a very nice serum. It has a great texture. I can tell that it has strong active ingredients because my skin is reacting to it similarly to when I started Tretinoin. However I haven’t really seen results yet. It’s only been a couple of weeks so I’m going to use the entire bottle before I make a final judgement. So far so good though. 
466827195, On PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum ,Becky E.,Combination,>55, Noticeably reduced fine lines the first time I used it. 
466827195, On PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum ,Rita V.,Combination,35-44, I love how my skin looks refreshed. This is my next go to! 
466827195, On PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum ,Jessica,Sensitive,25-35, I apply this on my skin every morning and night. It really works and gave my skin a fresh look. Has really helped my skin lifted and hydrated so much! My skin is smoother and hormonal breakouts much decreased. Can’t wait to try more of their products! 
466822449, On Stem Ⅲ Cream ,LW,Dry,18-24," This cream is beyond good. It makes my skin look like a baby's bottom lol. I usually have dull, dry skin that I can't seem to kick but one swipe of this on my face and my complexion is completely renewed. I'm obsessed!!!!! "
466822449, On Stem Ⅲ Cream ,Rita V.,Combination,55+, This amazing cream makes my skin so soft and hydrated! I did under estimate this cream and now it’s my next go to ! I love it! 
466822449, On Stem Ⅲ Cream ,Vivian O.,Combination,35-44," I love this product. It’s totally unscented if that’s a concern, and it’s relatively unassuming as far as packaging goes, plus it has a refillable option making it very eco friendly.  "
466828025, On Air Cushion SPF 50 ,Miles0716,Combination,35-44," Purchased this out-limb because I am always in the hunt for foundation or something similar that has spf in it. This is a game changer, I can’t speak anything bad about this and I am so glad this made it in my cart. "
466828025, On Air Cushion SPF 50 ,LSon,Combination,35-44, I can’t tell you how much I love Iope’s cushion foundation. I have combination sensitive skin and it provides the right amount coverage (not too much) and does not dry me out. It gives me the perfect clean and natural look! 
466828025, On Air Cushion SPF 50 ,Kitty,Combination,25-35," I love the way this feels on my face it's almost like silk. The vanilla color is a perfect color match for skin, which I was worried about.  "
466828025, On Air Cushion SPF 50 ,Karina L.,Dry,35-44," The coverage is light to medium if you build it up. It does cover redness well, but not pores. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Hira,18-24, No, Ufff i just got my secound bottle and loved it. I got this for my sister as well and she really like it. We both have different skin type! Great job cosrx!❤️ 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Jessica J., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, I’ve been using it for about three weeks now and really see improvements on my skin. I highly recommend this product. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Michelle,Dry,25-35, The texture is a bit slimy but the results speak for themselves. I’ve ordered more. 
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Julie,Fine Lines/Wrinkles,35-44," I have combination sensitive skin with rosacea and eczema. This product is great. I actually use it in the morning to add extra plump and hydration to my skin. This is one of the rare products I don't get reactive redness with. I don't really like the texture on my hands but once it's set into my skin, I like the way it makes my skin feel. I plan to try the cream with it next. "
12696970, On Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence ,Sindhu,Sensitive,25-35, This smoothens my skin and adds shine to my skin texture.. in love with this product 
34299045, On Real Ferment Micro Essence ,Erika,Sensitive,35-44," I've used this for 1-2 years and actually greatly prefer it over SK II (which I gave away to a friend). It's very calming , moisturizing, and helps plump up my skin. It works very well under sun screen and BB cream. "
34299045, On Real Ferment Micro Essence ,Waneda O.,Combination,35-44," This essence is awesome, really delivers like all the reviews I read. I like the packaging and the way the product feels when applied. "
34299045, On Real Ferment Micro Essence ,Josiah P.,Combination,18-24," This essence is singlehandedly brighting my old acne scars! The only reason I've rated it 4/5, is because no matter how many layers I add, it's still not as moisturizing as some other essence/toners I have in my skincare rotation. Otherwise, it's perfect! The glass bottle feels incredible high-end and there's a generous amount of product for the price. "
34299045, On Real Ferment Micro Essence ,Leaux,Combination,25-35, Was a recommended product. Took the advice & happy I did. Hydrates skin well. 
34299045, On Real Ferment Micro Essence ,Leidy R.,Normal,35-44," I’ve only used it for a couple of days, but so far so good! I feel my complexion is brighter and more hydrated. It doesn’t smell strong either and I like how it leaves my skin. "
466824632, On Super Vital Cream Rich ,Chevonne S.,Combination,35-44," I applied it to my face for the first time last night. It was VERY RICH and heavy imo. I am not sure if it is a good or bad thing yet as I would need more time to discern this, but for now, I think it feels too heavy to use during the day time if you're going out. If you're just going to stay home the whole day (or in my case work remotely), then I think it's fine to use it during the day too. But if you plan on heading out shortly after your facial routine, I personally wouldn't use this before an outing as it feels too rich. I will be back to update this after a few weeks/months to see if I see/feel any difference from using this cream. "
466824632, On Super Vital Cream Rich ,Gale C.,Combination,35-44, So smooth and smells great. Nice thick cream and my skin feels so moisturized. 
466824632, On Super Vital Cream Rich ,Sun M.,Combination,55+," I've been using IOPE's Super Vital Cream Rich for a few weeks now and I have to say, it's a game-changer for my skincare routine. Not only does it deeply moisturize my skin, but also leaves it feeling smooth and soft. It absorbs quickly without any sticky residue, and I've noticed a big improvement in the overall appearance of my skin. "
466828088, On UV Defense Sun Protector EX SPF 39 ,Eleanora S.,Combination,25-35," I'm super picky about the face sunscreens I use (mainly stick with EltaMd UV Clear with Supergoop unseen sunscreen as a runner-up), so I was surprised to find that I really enjoy this one! It comes out white but doesn't leave a white cast. It doesn't have the gross sunscreen smell I hate and it goes on light and leaves this beautiful glow--not oily or greasy at all! For reference, I have combination skin that leans dry + acne prone. Definitely recommend this one! "
466828088, On UV Defense Sun Protector EX SPF 39 ,Sun M.,Combination,55+," Wow, this product is absolutely amazing! Not only is it incredibly effective at what it does, but it's also super lightweight and absorbs into my skin in no time at all. Plus, it's so sheer on my skin that there's no residue or cast left behind. I absolutely cannot recommend this product enough – it's an absolute must-have! "
466828088, On UV Defense Sun Protector EX SPF 39 ,Rita V.,Combination,35-44, I love how it’s a lightweight sunscreen and has a nice smell. 
466828088, On UV Defense Sun Protector EX SPF 39 ,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35, This product is great. It’s not fragranced at all and has absolutely zero cast. I apply using the 2 finger rule so using a liberal amount of product and even before it’s fully absorbed I knew there’d be no case on my dark brown skin (think the great Coco Jones’ skin tone) so that’s saying a lot.  
477437671, On Night Off Face Wash ,Mac,Combination,25-35," i gotta say i was skeptical when this didn't feel like your typical cleanser or makeup remover jelly (I had bought Plenaire's before this, and it's fine but this is infinity times better). My tip for using Night Off is water makes all the difference - the consistency goes from being pretty thick and not very jelly-ish to slippery with minor suds. it takes ALL the makeup off with zero to minimal rubbing (and you really only need to rub if like me you like to wear triple coat mascara & tightlined eyeliner). I couldn’t believe it - the only time i’ve had makeup come off this easily was with Clean it Zero but Night Off is less oily and actually cleanses (ie not just taking makeup off). I really love this stuff, i’m saving so much money and time relative to my old cleansing routine. i’ve been using for ~2wks now and can safely say i’m never going back. "
477437671, On Night Off Face Wash ,amandaherrr,Dry,25-35, This cleanser has left my skin so clean and smooth! And most importantly it does remove my makeup with one wash!! I have dry skin and after wards it leaves it a little bit dry but I follow with a hydrating toner and it's no problem. This is such a unique cleanser and I am always impressed my this brand! 
12696962, On Acne Pimple Master Patch ,Dominique M.,18-24, No," Great under makeup and for the first few hours. Then it turns white, and it's more noticeable on the skin. I just like this to protect me from picking at my spots! "
12696962, On Acne Pimple Master Patch ,Laddie M., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, Great for overnight use but more noticeable. 
12696962, On Acne Pimple Master Patch ,Taya R.,Other,25-34," A God send when using on fresh pimples , they stick really well and work amazingly. Usually I find other brands to fall off in my sleep of not stick originally. This is my all time favourite and I love that it comes in many different sizes. "
12696962, On Acne Pimple Master Patch ,Emili P.,25-34, No, It helps 
12696962, On Acne Pimple Master Patch ,Mei, No,Other," my skin can break out pretty bad sometimes, but these patches help speed up the healing process so much! i stick one on at night and in the morning all the gunk is absorbed and the pimple is basically gone. i noticed that this patch works best if i stick it on before using other skincare items, or if the products i'm using before are lighter. "
457623877, On Pure Fit Cica Clear Cleansing Oil ,Savanah S.,25-34, No," I've been meaning to add dual-cleansing into my skincare routine, and ever since my friend got me hooked on COSRX I've been dutifully washing my face! I decided to try the cleansing oil, and I'm NOT disappointed! It really helps me feel that I'm removing all of my makeup/sunscreen before regularly cleansing (and it feels great)! "
457623877, On Pure Fit Cica Clear Cleansing Oil ,Maia H., No,Fine Lines/Wrinkles," I’m not too fond of the lemon essence in the oil, I think my skin might be a bit sensitive to it but overall it removes every last bit of my makeup even eyelash glue. "
457623877, On Pure Fit Cica Clear Cleansing Oil ,Sarah S.,Dull/Uneven Skin,18-24," Very thin consistency, applies nicely, dissolves my sunscreen/makeup and rinses clean.  "
457623877, On Pure Fit Cica Clear Cleansing Oil ,Kiley L.,25-34, No,"Only small issue is that the pump on my bottle is not 100% reliable, so occasionally I have to fiddle with that a bit. "
457623877, On Pure Fit Cica Clear Cleansing Oil ,Xia B., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, LOVE as a double cleanse! 
428419908, On Geumsul Eye Cream ,Aurora G.,Combination,45-55," Lovely, smooth and buttery. "
428419908, On Geumsul Eye Cream ,Angela,Dry,45-55,I have found a new favorite 
417264013, On I'm Pure Perfect Cica Sun Cream Jumbo ,Ricardo M.,Oily,<18," Apart from the obvious size difference, this is the same as the smaller size in quality. It spreads very easily and leaves my face matte and non sticky. It doesn’t have a white cast and really helps with controlling the sebum on my face. "
417264013, On I'm Pure Perfect Cica Sun Cream Jumbo ,Autumn J.,Oily,25-35, I’m still oily after wearing for only an hour. 
417264013, On I'm Pure Perfect Cica Sun Cream Jumbo ,X,Dry,25-35, I bought this because it was on sale and I desperately needed sun protection that was matte and non greasy.  
417264013, On I'm Pure Perfect Cica Sun Cream Jumbo ,Dorine C.,Oily,55+,"This DOES leave a white cast if you're darker than ""fair"" toned. It is matte, but if you touch your face- you can smell the chemicals on your hands. I may just give it away, I don't feel like going through the return process.  "
18592756, On Rich Moist Soothing Cream ,Joleena M.,Sensitive,18-24, i have used this product for years. i have also used the brand for years. it makes my skin feel so refreshed and hydrated. i have super sensitive and dry skin and this solves my problems! 
18592756, On Rich Moist Soothing Cream ,Charolyn M.,Dry,25-35, I have dry/sensitive skin and this moisturizer is my go-to product. I've tried others and I keep coming back to this one. 
18592756, On Rich Moist Soothing Cream ,Rhodora U.,Oily,45-55, Smooth and excellent in my face and hands 
18592756, On Rich Moist Soothing Cream ,Josiah P.,Combination,18-24," I've only used this product for a week, but in that amount of time closed comedones have popped up aaaall over my face like crazy! I really wanted to love this product because the texture is so wonderful, but something in it is seriously clogging my pores. After discontinuing use for four days (and with the help of the rest of my routine) my skin texture is returning to normal. "
6688737, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Wine ,mariya,Dry,35-44," Love the smell and love what it does to my skin. I only wish there was a way to utilize all of the liquid...i ran out of pads but there still was liquid at the bottom, so I sed my own scrubbies with it "
6688737, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Wine ,Sam,Normal,35-44, I leave them in the shower and it’s so easy. My skin feels so smooth when I use this product. Love how it smells. Brightens my skin. 
6688737, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Wine ,Stephanie.,Combination,25-35, I love what this has done for my skin! It was gifted to me and it was one of the best presents I’ve received. My only qualm with this is the smell. It smells a bit too sweet for my liking but not enough to deter me from purchasing again. 
6688737, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Wine ,Adria,Combination,18-24, After the first use my skin already started feeling insanely soft and clean! 
6688737, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Wine ,Shawna,Oily,35-44, This stuff smells so good! It makes me want to go have a glass of wine! It works really well too. It gets rid of my black head and leaves my son feeling super refreshed. 
942397, On Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule 5X ,soojung k.,Combination,45-55, Love this serum! Have been using it for years. Always my go to when I’m not trying something new or when my skin is in trouble. My husband always comments that my skin is glowing when I use missha time revolution serum. 
942397, On Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule 5X ,Jacqueline S.,Normal,35-44, This is one of those holy grail products. I naturally have combination skin but my moisture barrier is completely wrecked right now so I needed some thing that could improve things without being too harsh or too greasy. This completely addressed my texture problems and eliminated my fine lines all without not being too greasy. This stuff is liquid gold. 
942397, On Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule 5X ,Shawna,Dry,25-35, Feels good on the skin. A little goes a long way. 
942397, On Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule 5X ,Sab,Oily,35-44," In the past months I've become a chronic skin picker and THIS have absolutely saved my skin. I have pretty sensitive skin so I don't like to splurge on a product in case it irritates my skin, but this recent black friday I was running out of my hyaluronic acid serum and decided to purchase this as a replacement. Each day my skin looks clearer, less red, and has less scars than the day before. I have dry-combo skin so I will add this isn't as moisturizing as I thought, so for dry skin I would recommend pairing this with a moisturizing essence. "
6441860, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Drop ,Joleena M.,Sensitive,18-24," i have noticed my skin getting a bit lighter and it even looks brighter. i have super sensitive skin, dry, and i have eczema and i’m usually very hesitant to try new products like this. but so far, i have only positive reviews! "
6441860, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Drop ,Abbeyhinkle,Oily,18-24," This combined with the Klairs vitamin e mask work in harmony, I’ve already seen an improvement with my skin "
6441860, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Drop ,Robyn,Dry,25-35," I have purchased this serum several times because, truly, it is one of my favs! Considering the price as well, I think it's a steal. I find my skin tone is more even, my texture is lessened, and my acne scars look way less red. I also have found that I can use it with other actives, like salicylic acid serums. "
6441860, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin C Drop ,Rohini,Sensitive,25-35, I started having red rashes and burning sensation after using the serum for the first three days. I tried switching it up to weekly twice but still my skin would burn. Had a lot of expectations from this serum 
34734335, On Pore Cleansing Oil [PHA] ,Isabella,Dry,18-24," I have been using this cleanser for almost a year now and I love it. I use it every single night to remove my makeup, and it is so gentle that you can get it in your eyes with no problem. It never strips my moisture barrier. I recommend it 100% "
34734335, On Pore Cleansing Oil [PHA] ,Sam,Sensitive,18-24," My skin breaks out on my cheeks and forehead when I use this. It definitely removes my makeup, but the breakouts are not worth it. "
34734335, On Pore Cleansing Oil [PHA] ,Abby,Combination,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
230102707, On Day-Light Protection Airy Sunscreen ,Sara,Sensitive,18-24," This sunscreen has worked for my skin for years--at various points, I've suffered from acne, facial eczema, and dryness. This product has never contributed to any of these conditions, and I'm impressed that it continues to work and not be visible throughout my different skin problems. "
230102707, On Day-Light Protection Airy Sunscreen ,Karen R.,Combination,55+, This is my favorite product to use daily. I have been using this sunscreen for about 2 years now and I always make sure I have an extra in my drawer. It 
230102707, On Day-Light Protection Airy Sunscreen ,Maria P.,Combination,25-35,goes on so nicely and blends into your skin without feeling heavy or having 
230102707, On Day-Light Protection Airy Sunscreen ,Blake,Sensitive,18-24,a white cast. Most importantly I do a lot of outside work during the day and I have never had a sundurnt nose ever. It feels good to know I’m doing my best for my skin. I have given this as a gift to several nieces who like it so much they have purchased their own. 
230102707, On Day-Light Protection Airy Sunscreen ,Morgan D.,Combination,18-24, I love this sunscreen 
104208452, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Toner ,Alia,Combination,35-44," My skin hates chemical exfoliating serums so I was nervous about this but it never irritated my skin, even with every day use and I hardly used my regular exfoliants at all. Would recommend for sure "
104208452, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Toner ,Kelley A.,Sensitive,25-35, I have a lot of stubborn acne and this was gentle enough to use once a day and helped get rid of a lot of texture without being overly drying 
104208452, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Toner ,Ian C.,Combination,25-35, Excellent 
104208452, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Toner ,Pamela V.,Combination,25-35, Is the best! 
104208452, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Toner ,blake,Sensitive,18-24," A little goes a long way with this toner, it smells great, it didn’t irritate my sensitive skin, and it didn’t leave my skin feeling tight after using it. "
43989137, On Time Stop Collagen Ampoule ,Jinah,Normal,35-44, Love this ampoule that makes my skin feel so tight and elastic! 
43989137, On Time Stop Collagen Ampoule ,Mariya,Dry,35-44, This is my staple and I buy several bottles at once. Makes a visible difference in my skin. 
43989137, On Time Stop Collagen Ampoule ,CC,Normal,25-35, Moisturizing and dried quick on the skin. I’m not sure if it’s worth the price though so I have yet to repurchase and probably would not be repurchasing. 
159952441, On C’s The Day Serum ,Abbey,Oily,18-24," I have ordered this one a few times but stopped using it a while back bc I forgot to re-order. Definitely getting it again, it really helps with my hyperpigmentation / acne scars! "
159952441, On C’s The Day Serum ,M. T.,Oily,35-44," I was a bit nervous buying this. I've used the old formula and loved it, so I was scared the new one would not work well with my skin. I was wrong. It feels exactly the same as the old one but better. I have oily and sensitive skin and my skin and it worked well with me. It definitely does not oxidize as quickly as the old one. It goes on nicely and does not cause my sunscreen to pill. Will definitely repurchase. "
159952441, On C’s The Day Serum ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," I used the whole bottle, my experience with it was ok. Not really any complaints, it went on smooth and wasn’t sticky. People seem to dislike the smell but I didn’t think it had much of a scent so that’s a positive. This one just didn’t seem to do as much for my skin as past serums. But my skin is picky, so could just be a miss for my skin which ok:) worth the trial "
159952441, On C’s The Day Serum ,Deanna R.,Combination,25-35," Great, simple vitamin C for daily use! Definitely helped with hyperpigmentation. Would recommend! "
159952441, On C’s The Day Serum ,Katerina F.,Combination,35-44, Great texture 
7187620, On Green Tea Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Julie,Sensitive,25-35," I have combination sensitive skin with rosacea and eczema. I love this face soap. It feels very luxurious and smells like a spa. I try other fun face washes every now and again but always come back to this one. As someone with reactive skin, this is my holy grail face wash. "
7187620, On Green Tea Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Bella,Dry,18-24," I have very dry skin and so I switched to oil-based cleansers after trying this one, which had been recommended in my skin concierge thing. I like the clean feeling from this cleanser but I could only use it every two weeks or my skin would get too dry. If you have dry skin and are looking for an everyday cleanser I would recommend something else. "
7187620, On Green Tea Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Camille,Combination,18-24,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you.

69145804, On CPP Collagen 80% Intensive Eye Cream ,TLee,Sensitive,45-55, Will buy again! 
69145804, On CPP Collagen 80% Intensive Eye Cream ,Camille,Sensitive,25-35," So far so good! Gel, feeling léger, hydrate bien "
69145804, On CPP Collagen 80% Intensive Eye Cream ,Claire,Combination,18-24," I've never been one to obsess over eye creams in fact, I often think they do nothing. While I see no extreme benefits from this mask, my eye area is moisturized. "
23283856, On Hyaluron Skin Essence ,Fabiola N.,Normal,25-35," Excellent product, I feel my skin healthier. I definitely would recommend "
23283856, On Hyaluron Skin Essence ,Skyler B.,Dry,25-35," I got a bottle of this ages ago and loved it, but decided to try different products. I'm very glad I switched back - this makes my skin feel moisturized and hydrated (I follow with a heavier face cream to lock in) even on super cold, dry days. "
23283856, On Hyaluron Skin Essence ,hana,Oily,18-24," This product really helps keep my skin dewy and help keep my skin moisturized during the colder months. it absorbs quickly to the skin, and it doesn't make the skin feels sticky, which is a HUGE plus! "
23283856, On Hyaluron Skin Essence ,Christina K.,Dry,35-44, Keeps my dry skin hydrated without causing clogged pores or breakouts. 
23283856, On Hyaluron Skin Essence ,Vanessa W.,Oily,35-44," I’ve used many, many essences and this is the most hydrating and beautifying one I’ve ever used. Purchased twice now. "
3044636, On Aloe BHA Skin Toner ,Eleanora S.,Combination,25-35," Doesn't do anything for my skin (I have combination skin and get occasional breakouts). It also has a weird, viscosey texture. Toner is supposed to help you feel extra clean and I feel like this one does the opposite. "
3044636, On Aloe BHA Skin Toner ,Ellie L.,Sensitive,25-35,We are so sorry to hear this product did not work out for you. Please reach out to us via e-mail with your order number and we'll be happy to get you all sorted! 
3044636, On Aloe BHA Skin Toner ,Cami,Combination,25-35, Great for sensitive skin 
12696964, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon ,nhi p.,Dry,<18, best gentle physical exfoliater for dry skin. smells amazing! 
12696964, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon ,Sim,Dry,18-24," I got this as a sample twice. Both times I used it, my skin immediately felt soft. It may or may not have made some pimples surface, but I'm not sure if it is absolutely because of the peels. Overall it was good. "
12696964, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon ,Julia J.,Combination,25-35, These are amazing! I would buy them over and over just because they make my skin feel so smooth after I rinse. I haven’t been breaking out as much and I feel that my skin absorbs products better afterwards. 
12696964, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon ,Odile M.,Oily,25-35," I've tried all the varieties of these (green tea, wine and now lemon) and the lemon is my favorite! Love the scent and my skin felt so smooth afterwards. Only used once so far, but looking forward to see the effects of the brightening from the lemon :) "
12696964, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Lemon ,Sydney,Combination,18-24, A Sephora employee recommended this product to me 3 years ago when I was breaking out badly (Sephora didn't even carry the Neogen brand anymore). These pads have changed my life. I use them twice a week and they dramatically improved my breakouts and skin texture. My skin feels so soft after using and they never irritate me. I can't see myself ever not using them! 
57546371, On Real Ferment Micro Serum ,Zannate,Combination,25-35," I’ve had this on my wish list for a while but finally ordered it because there was a sale on the website. It is worth every dime, it helped clear my skin of acne as well as scarring and gave my face an overall plump appearance. Will be ordering a second bottle! "
57546371, On Real Ferment Micro Serum ,Felicia,Combination,25-35, This is great for anyone struggling with moisture. I like stacking it with a moisturizer for an extra boost. 
57546371, On Real Ferment Micro Serum ,Bailey,Sensitive,25-35," This is a very thick serum, moisturizing. Sometimes if I'm not going anywhere, I skip my moisturizer and just keep this on. Great product . "
57546371, On Real Ferment Micro Serum ,C R.,Combination,18-24, Love this stuff and my skin does too. It's hydrating enough on it's own during muggy summers and a perfect serum layer during the dry winters. A little goes a long way and it's in a small enough bottle for a carry-on (it has definetly earned it's spot in the travel bag... I can't imagine washing my face without it). Have purchased twice and hope it is never discontinued. 
17975071, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Stick ,Vananh B.,Combination,35-44," I exfoliate my face every single time I'm in the shower for years. People say that I should stop exfoliating so much and cut back. It took over a decade for me to even try to switch. Now that I've been introduced to this green tea cleansing stick that makes my skin feel clean and smooth, I am extremely satisfied changing up my skin care products and routine. "
17975071, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Stick ,Anh V.,Combination,45-55, This stick is so handy for travelling and lathers very well. I feel so clean and refreshed after using it. 
17975071, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Stick ,RACHEL C.,Normal,35-44," Love this green tea stick cleanser! This is my go-to travel cleanser. Love that it is solid so it doesn't take up valuable liquid space in my carry on. So convenient and easy to use. It works great as a quick double cleanse in the morning and after a workout. It has gentle exfoliation, so it's like a 3 in one! I have normal skin that can get dehydrated but this cleanser leaves my skin clean and soft, not tight or dry. I love it. I will continue buying this. I think it is a wonderful product. My teen daughter loves it too. "
17975071, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Stick ,Glenda M.,Normal,>55, I use this at home and when I travel. Cleans my face without drying and helps with breakouts. I like to travel with it because it’s not liquid and won’t leak. 
17975071, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Stick ,elizabeth h.,Combination,25-35," I love that this cleanser is a solid, making it super easy to travel with! This is the second time I've purchased and I think it will be part of my travel routine for a long time. It cleanses well and smells great, but not too strong. "
903189, On Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream ,Holly,Sensitive,35-44," It has a lovely texture and the fragrance didn't bother me at all. However, my sensitive skin could not handle it. My skin became extremely dry and I ended up getting a rash on my face. It took a couple of weeks for it to clear up and I'm still not able to get back to my usual makeup routine (but that may be partially due to winter weather). If you have sensitive skin, maybe skip this one. "
903189, On Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream ,KIARA R.,Combination,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
903189, On Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream ,Dani,Combination,25-35," I used to never moisturize. But now that I just turned 40, I figured I should take better care of myself internally and externally. Had I known about this super light and absorbent cream that leaves my face plumped and tight, I would of moisturize earlier in my life! "
112573943, On Collagen Essential Lifting & Firming Sheet Mask ,Victoria S.,Combination,45-55, Make skin soft 
112573943, On Collagen Essential Lifting & Firming Sheet Mask ,Julia J.,Combination,25-35, I love the way the masks adhere to the face ( not literally ) but they stay so well put on the skin until all the product is absorbed. My skin feels much firmer ! 
112573943, On Collagen Essential Lifting & Firming Sheet Mask ,Bailey,Combination,18-24," This product is definitely hydrating, but not greasy at all. Great for my combination skin. Didn't make my oily spots break out and hydrated everywhere. I have combination sensitive skin, and I would recommend this to anyone. "
112573943, On Collagen Essential Lifting & Firming Sheet Mask ,Hailey,Combination,25-35, The mask leaves my skin feeling super hydrated and it also fits very well 
455971, On Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ ,Sarah I.,Normal,25-35, I was SHOCKED how well this blended with my skin! It’s great coverage but still feels light as if I’m only wearing my skin products. I absolutely love this!! 
455971, On Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ ,Danielle,Dry,35-44," I can't stand using foundation because I can never find anything that doesn't feel too thick on my face; normally, it just sits there and feels like it exists to smudge everywhere. I like using just basic concealers or tinted sunscreen, but I tried this and I don't know if I'll ever go back. It moisturizes, it's not greasy or sticky or thick, and it still provides the coverage I need for my skin, which tends toward dry, red, sensitive, and sometimes flaky on my T-zone. I don't notice any flakes when I apply this, and it goes on very evenly. "
455971, On Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ ,Sara N.,Dry,25-35,My only qualm is that I do feel like it's a *touch* too gray where I wish it was a bit more beige. 
455971, On Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ ,Arya M.,Normal,25-35," I have been buying this for a few years and this is actually what I use as my foundation! I love that it has SPF, and it allows me to dress my skin up, while also protecting it's barrier. This is been a game changer for me in my makeup routine. "
15926898, On Supple Preparation Facial Toner ,hillary,Oily,25-35," This is an excellent toner. It’s a bit on the thicker side which makes it easier to apply than many of the more watery toners out there. It feels very nourishing and soothing, and definitely adds a nice layer of lightweight hydration. I would repurchase this one! "
15926898, On Supple Preparation Facial Toner ,Emily,Dry,18-24, I've used this toner for 2 years and I recommend this to everyone! It's the first step of my daily morning and night routine because it preps my skin SO well before I apply other products. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and clean. I'm always reordering this!! 
15926898, On Supple Preparation Facial Toner ,TC,Sensitive,18-24," I have sensitive skin, but it still held up for this toner. However, I did stop using this product over time in an effort to reduce my use of products with fragrance. On the bright side, there is a new toner in this line that is fragrance free so give that a go if you had a similar worry like myself. "
15926898, On Supple Preparation Facial Toner ,Suzanne K.,Normal,35-44, I love this toner. It smells great and really preps my skin for my serums and essences. 
15926898, On Supple Preparation Facial Toner ,Heidi,Dry,18-24," I am 24 with dry/sensitive. I have purchased multiple bottles of this toner. It is one of the most hydrating toners I have used. It doesn't take much product to get the entire face. It absorbs quickly as well. It is a great base to start layering hydration. I will continue to use this is my daily routine. I will say though it doesn't seem to get any left over oil/dirt off the face, so make sure you cleanse your face well. "
170715666, On Glow Serum ,Hannah,Normal,<18," I love this serum, I have oily skin and this give me a wonderful glow from within, without the greasy feeling. I follow it with a gel moisturizer and it makes my skin look so hydrated and looks like glass skin "
170715666, On Glow Serum ,Bella D.,Oily,25-35, Love it! Got it once getting it again it is a little sticky but other than that it’s great! 
170715666, On Glow Serum ,Justine,Dry,<18," For me this did not make me glow. It leaves my skin the same as it is pretty dull. I have broken blood vessels on one of my cheeks and sensitive skin, and it actually makes the other cheek more red. So unfortunately this isn't really good for me. I use it at night only now, hoping it gives me more moisture if anything. "
73510125, On Snail Bee Ultimate Serum ,Rohini,Sensitive,25-35, I have a sensitive skin and this is the only new product I incorporated in my skin care regime. My skin started have severe rash after 4 days of using the product 
73510125, On Snail Bee Ultimate Serum ,Jan R.,Combination,45-55, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
73510125, On Snail Bee Ultimate Serum ,Britney A.,Combination,45-55, Been using this serum for a couple of weeks and it has made a great difference in the appearance of my skin. I have notice a slight difference with some spots that I have. I notice that there are becoming less visible. 
73510125, On Snail Bee Ultimate Serum ,Sameerah T.,Combination,25-35, One of my faves! I buy this religiously every couple of months when I am almost out. It is one of the most benefits I’ve seen to my skin. I love the glow and just love it. 
37675495, On MadeCera Cream ,Jennifer S.,Combination,35-44, I got this first as a sample and used it when I was struggling with winter dryness on a new level this year. My skin would not stop flaking and was breaking out in other places. This helped calm my skin immediately. My cushion foundation also goes on smoothly when I’ve got this on. I used this after exfoliating and layered another overnight repair moisturizer over it and the next morning my skin was smooth and calm! 
37675495, On MadeCera Cream ,Taylor,Dry,25-35, I liked the product but the packaging is what is keeping me from repurchasing. The container is made of some type of metal and it's impossible to get the rest of the product out. 
37675495, On MadeCera Cream ,Xerfence E.,Normal,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
112574033, On Tea Tree Essential Blemish Control Sheet Mask ,Spdgonz92,Combination,25-35, Love these sheet masks! Has helped my inflamed acne and noticed my skin a little plumper. Will continue buying. 
112574033, On Tea Tree Essential Blemish Control Sheet Mask ,Carmen D.,Sensitive,25-35, These are my favorite ! Great for sensitive skin and gentle to use. 
112574033, On Tea Tree Essential Blemish Control Sheet Mask ,Makayla,Dry,18-24, I purchased these at a time when my cystic acne was most inflamed. I paired them with calming products and the difference was so amazing I cried because of the relief. Using them twice a week with pimple patches and a good routine made a huge difference. The tea tree is not too strong to dry out my naturally dry skin. Whenever I have flare ups and I don’t have these on hand I wish I do! 
112574033, On Tea Tree Essential Blemish Control Sheet Mask ,Amanda,Dry,18-24," I always had redness around the cheek area and sometimes it irritates my skin, I always put on this mask for like twice-3x a week and it helps relieve the irritation and reduce my redness a bit. "
112574033, On Tea Tree Essential Blemish Control Sheet Mask ,Makaela,Sensitive,25-35," I really like these. I feel they help with my breakouts and redness. I would have to wash my face after if I wanted to put on makeup, though. "
2738662, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Purifying ,Sara C.,Combination,25-35," I love the texture, very smooth and soft. I’ve noticed improvements with my skins texture and I feel like it helps my cleanser work better. "
2738662, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Purifying ,Becky C.,Combination,25-35," i love love love this stuff!!! if i run out, my face just doesn’t feel like it’s getting as thoroughly cleaned!! "
2738662, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Purifying ,Christine P.,Sensitive,25-35, I love this balm. It clears off all my makeup and has a pleasant smell. 
2738662, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Purifying ,Lauren Y.,Sensitive,35-44," I’ve repurchased this probably more than any other skincare item. I always try others but this is the best for my extremely sensitive, acne-prone, somewhat oily skin. Nothing irritating , drying, or comedogenic in it. Very soothing and elegant formula. My only complaint is that I prefer the convenience and hygiene of oil and pump formulas over balms. "
2738662, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Purifying ,Laura T.,Combination,25-35," I like this cleansing balm. I gave four out of five because there are some that are better, although I do wear a full face of makeup almost every day and sunscreen and work in a dirty warehouse so I need something powerful. This one does a good job and it rinses away nicely. "
12696965, On Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser ,Brooke,25-34, No, This gel cleanser really gets my skin clean in the morning without leaving me feeling like my skin is tight and stripped of moisture. You can smell the tea tree in it but I find that invigorating in the morning. 
12696965, On Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser ,Kassandra E., No,Dull/Uneven Skin," This gel cleanser is great! A dot-sized goes a long way and cleans the face nicely. The smell is also a nice touch and makes me feel like my face is being medicated (if that makes sense). Buy, buy, buy! "
12696965, On Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser ,Mika H.,Other,25-34, Leaves a Soft and supple feeling. Gorgeous. Like it a lot. 
12696965, On Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser ,Jack V.,18-24, No, Did not itch smells so good 🤍🤍 
12696965, On Low-pH Good Morning Cleanser ,Kevin P., No,Fine Lines/Wrinkles," Love the tea tree oil. Smells very fresh. Leaves skin clean but not drying. Fun to use. Bubble , bubble, foils all the grime and oil. "
50577384, On Pore Cleansing Oil [BHA] ,Blake,Sensitive,18-24," Doesn’t leave my sensitive skin feeling tight, and you don’t need to use a whole lot for it to cover your entire face "
50577384, On Pore Cleansing Oil [BHA] ,M P.,Oily,35-44, Purchased this cleanser as part of my double cleanse routine because it's specifically for oily skin. Really easy to use. Works well on my skin. Good value as well. 
50577384, On Pore Cleansing Oil [BHA] ,Erica J.,Normal,25-35, Second time I’ve bought this- my favourite first step for my nightly routine 
50577384, On Pore Cleansing Oil [BHA] ,Autumn J.,Oily,25-35, Very nice but I do not enjoy the oily feeling left on my skin after I use this. It makes me feel like my moisturizer isn’t sitting on my skin but on a layer of oil. 
50577384, On Pore Cleansing Oil [BHA] ,AJ,Combination,<18," i use this before using a New Leaf cleanser, and it doesn't make my skin feel stripped at off. it does a good job of cleaning my face. i use this every night and day! "
112574027, On N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Sheet Mask ,Isabel,Dry,18-24, This sheet mask does one thing and it does it well - it moisturizes my skin so well.  
112574027, On N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Sheet Mask ,Marie,Sensitive,35-44,"It has a lot of serum, the sheet is thick and after using the mask I don't feel the need to use moisturizer after. Such a great find for dry skin made drier with desert climate. "
112574027, On N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Sheet Mask ,Heidi,Dry,25-35, This mask is great for re-hydrating your skin after a long day! I left it on for 10-minutes and my face still had a lot of excess essence I was able to pay into my skin. Can’t wait for the next spa day! So I can use this again. 
112574027, On N.M.F Intensive Hydrating Sheet Mask ,Tie,Dry,25-35," Amazing face masks, leaves my skin softer, gives it a glow, smooth, and plump! "
20602149, On H2 Dermadeca Serum Spray ,Jennifer S.,Combination,35-44," I had been looking for a good spray to refresh my face throughout the day for a while. I had tried another spray that didn’t feel like it added moisture. This spray feels amazing. I use it as a finishing spray after makeup. Will definitely be purchasing again, maybe even a bottle to keep at work. I LOVE how it makes my face feel. Cooling and a touch of moisture "
20602149, On H2 Dermadeca Serum Spray ,Waneda O.,Combination,35-44, I absolutely love this spray serum! It applies wonderfully and I like the spray when I’m in a hurry for some extra hydration. 
20602149, On H2 Dermadeca Serum Spray ,Na'ilah S.,Normal,25-35, I bought this to keep in my gym bag. After I work out I sit in the Duane for about 30 minutes. My skin gets dry and tight before it gets sweaty. So I spray this generously and it keeps me soft smooth and moist in that dry heat 
20602149, On H2 Dermadeca Serum Spray ,Vananh B.,Combination,35-44, I use this when I'm on the go. A few sprays under 1 minute and I'm all set! Keeps my face moisturize. I also use it before and after my makeup. 
20602149, On H2 Dermadeca Serum Spray ,Mila,Combination,25-35, I have fun when I use this product. It helps regain that moisture quickly and leaves a refreshing feeling. 
15507472, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Green Tea ,Anthony P.,Combination,25-35," I have sensitive skin that is a combination of oily and dry. The bio peel gauze is lightweight, smells great, and gently cleans and exfoliates the skin. I’ve been using the product for a few weeks now and I can tell a change in my skin. It’s fresh and moisturized "
15507472, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Green Tea ,Michelle C.,Normal,25-35," I've tried other ""flavors"" of this Bio-peel gauze, and the Green Tea specifically works so well with my skin! I don't exfoliate too often, but when I feel my skin starting to break out, I use this gauze and the next morning my skin is back to normal! Typically, I end up using this anywhere from once biweekly up to once a month! Easy to use, stores well, and works amazingly! "
15507472, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Green Tea ,ALT,Combination,18-24," Great scrubbing pad, Feels nice and gets all of my dead skin off. It is a bit rough so sensitive skin types might want to use less frequently. Very smooth skin though! "
15507472, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Green Tea ,Nadia,Combination,25-35," I’ve been using this product since several months now , once a week, and I really like it ‘ it exfoliâtes my skin gently and let it soft and fresh. I recommend "
15507472, On Bio-Peel Gauze Peeling Green Tea ,Meghan W.,Combination,25-35, I use these once a week and feel like they really help keep my skin breakout free. They don’t feel too abrasive or harsh. This is a staple for sure. 
34414535, On SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream ,Cynthia H.,Sensitive,35-44, This barrier intensive cream works wonderfully on my skin and also at this price point perfect for slathering on. Have already repurchased several times! 
34414535, On SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream ,Blake,Sensitive,18-24," Usually my skin reacts badly to any new moisturizer I try, this one didn’t burn me at all and left my skin feeling hydrated for hours after I used it "
34414535, On SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream ,Ima E.,Sensitive,45-55," Love the twist top closure of the tube. Handy, clean, prevents leaks. The cream itself is fantastic. Hydrates my skin and gives it a glow. It's exactly what my face needed for winter dryness. Bought some for my mom and she's now a major fan too. "
34414535, On SoonJung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream ,Sarah,Dry,18-24, Made my eczema flare up on my cheek and gave me a rash on my neck :/ really bummed because of all the positive reviews. Feels nice going on and has a good consistency though 
15342185, On Midnight Blue Calming Cream ,Kelley A.,Sensitive,25-35, I use this most nights and my skin barrier seems much happier than with other products I've tried 
15342185, On Midnight Blue Calming Cream ,Amber C.,Combination,25-35, Great at hydrating irritated/sensitive skin. 
15342185, On Midnight Blue Calming Cream ,Briana B.,Sensitive,25-35, Great product. Wish it was slightly more hydrating but I just apply a hydrating serum before using the cream. 
15342185, On Midnight Blue Calming Cream ,Paulina F.,Combination,25-35," I continue to buy this cream. For me. For my friends. Anyone honestly. Not only does it do wonders for my face. And doesn’t have a scent (I have very sensitive skin). It’s just amazing. My face gets extremely dried out. I’m the chick who tries to be consistent but ya. I get depressed. & skip the self care. I go out and fall asleep with my makeup on. And when it gets real bad. I cleanse my face, use toner and then put this on before bed.. my face feels so much better the next day. No dry patches that show in my makeup. I have bought this for two of my girlfriends. One of them went to Hawaii got super sunburnt. Nothing worked so she put this cream on her thigh just to see if it would help. Next morning the burn was gone. Overall?! This is a staple. And my friends love it. My favorite night cream by far "
15342185, On Midnight Blue Calming Cream ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," Very hydrating, very light feeling on your face, and not sticky feeling after application. The texture is kind of jelly like and the color is pretty "
3324884, On Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel ,Carly C.,Dry,25-35," This is part of my core essential routine year round! Great to use alone in the summer, and great to use under a thicker moisturizer during the winter months. I've never had any reaction to this, it's very lightweight and relatively affordable. I'll always make sure to have a back up on hand! "
3324884, On Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel ,Ree,Combination,25-35, This is been my go-to moisturizer for years now! It's super hydrating without being too thick. 
3324884, On Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel ,Anne,Combination,18-24, I have had acne prone skin and scarring for years. This is better than anything my derm has ever given me! It came in my allure beauty box and now I’m hooked. I use it in the morning and before bed. Especially great after exfoliations. Keep it in the fridge! I am buying more because I’m worried it’s going to go viral on TikTok 
3324884, On Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel ,Ilona K.,Sensitive,<18," I purchased mostly for my daughter who struggles with acne. I can tell that this gel does his work in soothing skin, elimination of red spots and irritated skin. I even applied to my hair just a pea size but it didn't work well. "
3324884, On Aloe Propolis Soothing Gel ,Ava,Sensitive,18-24, The only thing I liked about this product was how soothing and cooling it felt once applied to skin. I was not a fan of the sticky and tacky feeling it left behind. 
38124264, On A-Thera Tea Tree Peeling Sticks ,Meghan W.,Combination,25-35, If you ever get breakouts these are a must-have! I use them once a week and they clear up any spots right away. They don’t feel harsh and leave my skin looking great. 
38124264, On A-Thera Tea Tree Peeling Sticks ,Crystal,Combination,25-35," Let me tell you I had the clearest skin using these peeling sticks, add a good moisturizer and spf and you got a great combo here. "
38124264, On A-Thera Tea Tree Peeling Sticks ,Evan K.,Combination,25-35, Read these were great to use with the cleanser for those struggling with hormonal acne. I haven’t seen much difference yet but maybe it’s too soon to tell. Hoping month 2 will show more progress. 
43972019, On Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid 100 ,Juli,Dry,35-44, I notice all this does once I run out! Moisturizing and helps control breakouts 
43972019, On Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid 100 ,Juli,Dry,Dry," I buy again over and over, when I run out my skin is dry and breaking out. "
43972019, On Waterfall Moist Balanced Hyaluronic Acid 100 ,El.,Combination,25-35," I was excited to try this product. I love that this product is vegan and doesn't have harsh ingredients. I finished the bottle, but that's easy to do since there's not much product inside. I was very happy so say it did not irritate my skin but it left an unpleasant sticky film over my skin. I tried lots of different ways of using this product but it just didn't absorb the way I would have liked it to. It may work for you but this one isn't for me and I didn't feel like it was worth the price. "
37013542, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask ,Ingrid,Sensitive,25-35," I put this on my face and can practically immediately see a difference in my skin. It's so much brighter and calmer and healthier. It helps heal my acne but also the spots where I've scratched at my acne and created scabs also heal dramatically more quickly thanks to this mask. I use it once a day, every night, for about three or four weeks now, and it's a holy grail for me. My skin is very dry with rosacea and sensitive, and I plan to order more when this jar runs out. "
37013542, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask ,Melvy,Sensitive,35-44, I have been using this cream for a year I have rosacea and this cream helped me completely my skin looks very good with a uniform color I do not have any rosacea I would not change this cream for anything 
37013542, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask ,McKenna,Normal,18-24, This was product is nice and hydrating. Didn’t cause irritation or rednesses. I have normal and acne prone skin. The reason why I took stars off is because it is absolutely ruined by the packaging. The shimmering design on the front rubbed off and into my fingers from me opening the jar and (not realizing this) used those same fingers to rub the product into my face. This is the last step in my routine before turning off my light and going to bed so I didn’t notice the flaked off packaging sitting on my skin until several weeks later. This may seem dramatic but thinking about these flakes sitting on my skin all night multiple times makes me super uncomfortable and disgusted. I am going to rip the label off immediately when I repurchase. 
37013542, On Freshly Juiced Vitamin E Mask ,Sravani P.,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,Tamara,Combination,<18, This really works! Just don't like how bulky the packaging is. They come in lil capsules each for reference 
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,Janessa C.,Combination,25-35, After constantly debating whether or not to get this I finally did for those days I receive a cystic pimple and I will say it wasn’t as fast acting as a regular pimple patch. In two patches (2 nights/1 a night) my pimple dramatically decreased. I am quite pleased with it! 
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,cbm,Combination,25-35," 5 stars because it works (although I would probably subtract a star if I accounted for the price). This is too expensive for smaller acne/white heads. COSRX is good for those. This one though, is great for cystic acne/those stubborn pimples buried deep down that regular, less expensive hydrocolloid patches can't get through. "
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,Shihan,Oily,25-35," This.absolutely.works. I was pretty skeptical initially because nothing ever works on my cystic acne, ever. Unless I go to the derm for a cortisone injection. But after 2 patches, it drew the xxx cyst to the surface and turn into a head. I am super impressed that the product actually works for cystic acne. Finally!!!!! Though it is pretty expensive ($19.90 for 6 patches, 6 swabs). My cyst did not go away totally though. Definitely buy. "
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,Tara,Sensitive,35-44, I’ve tried so many patches and this one really helps with those deep zits. Very happy! 
80494569, On Sun Project Light Sun Essence ,Darcy,Normal,25-35," This sunscreen feels lovely. It leaves no residue, feels light and airy, and smells only barely.  "
80494569, On Sun Project Light Sun Essence ,Jinah,Sensitive,25-35,I have purchased this now 3 times and recommend it fully to everyone! I really love it and it feels excellent on my skin. 
80494569, On Sun Project Light Sun Essence ,TLee,Normal,35-44," Was in search for a light-weight, moisturizing sunscreen that doesn’t leave a white-cast or break me out. I found that with this product! I recommend it to anyone and it’s become a staple in my routine. "
80494569, On Sun Project Light Sun Essence ,Skylar,Sensitive,45-55, This sunscreen is super light since it's an essence. I prefer something thicker but this will do the trick if you're looking for something lighter. 
34299034, On SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner ,Anahi,Combination,25-35," This toner may look basic and boring but I will say if you want a simple toner with no frills, then this is it. It is basically like water on my skin but has soothing ingredients like panthenol, centella, and green tea. Great for those with a weak skin barrier. I do not suffer from a broken skin barrier so this toner is not for me but it is still good nonetheless. "
34299034, On SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner ,Nakea,Dry,25-35," My skin gets very dry in the winter and this is one of my staple products. I use 2 to 3 layers and that's enough for my skin to feel soft, supple and hydrated. "
34299034, On SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner ,Rachael W.,Sensitive,<18, this toner is very relaxing and soothing. I often have breakouts and allergic reactions to many products but I've never had any issues with this product in fact it has helped significantly! 
34299034, On SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner ,M D.,Normal,18-24, This product is so reliable. The Panthenol in here is formulated well and really keeps my skin calm and soothed during the weather changes. 
34299034, On SoonJung pH 5.5 Relief Toner ,Ryann,Normal,18-24, I was recommended this to reduce redness for normal skin but it just made me feel hot and my redness worsened over more uses. It won’t go away even after cooling methods. I got the cleanser of the same line and tried it without this toner and my redness didn’t appear. Total placebo 
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,RB,Dry,25-35," This serum is just ok. It doesn't do much to my skin, especially in the winter. It almost feels like applying water on my skin and that is about it. I loved the Rich Moist Soothing Cream and thought the serum would be great too but unfortunately, it is a let down. "
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,Cindy Z.,Combination,18-24, We are sorry to hear that about your Rich Moist Soothing Serum. Please reach out to us via email at 
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,Sandra G.,Dry,18-24, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,Sandra,Sensitive,45-55," I bought the full size of this because I loved a sample I had gotten of it. It had felt super smooth and hydrating but when I got the full size it just didn't feel the same. It also had a different smell, like the plastic that pool inflatables are made of. The smell doesn't really bother me and I still like the serum overall, but it would've been 5 stars for me if it was the same as the sample I tried. "
50009730, On Supple Preparation Unscented Facial Toner ,Kiki,Combination,25-35," I've NEVER used a toner with this consistency before! I wish all toners were thick like this. A little goes a long way and I'm pretty committed to making this my go-to. Plumps and preps the face amazingly. Make sure to wait 2-3 minutes after applying it since it is thick and wet. Foaming is normal but if you pat it in after minimally rubbing it in, it'll subside. "
50009730, On Supple Preparation Unscented Facial Toner ,S,Combination,18-24, it foams up a lot. 
50009730, On Supple Preparation Unscented Facial Toner ,Helen,Dry,35-44,I have to fan my face to dry it off before continuing to the next step or else it'll foam up like soap and not fully absorbs into the skin 
159952473, On On The Bright Side Moisturizer ,Anthony P.,Sensitive,25-35," I love this moisturizer, it isn’t heavy but you know it’s working. My skin is thoroughly moisturized and appears dewy. A single application lasts all day and I never feel oily or clogged. I have sensitive, combination skin and have had no issues or adverse reactions. "
159952473, On On The Bright Side Moisturizer ,Hazel,Sensitive,25-35," the product works great but I had a hard time knowing how much product was even left in it. I'll probably buy it again because it's the best moisturizer my partner has used in terms of results. However, I'll use something else due to the annoying packaging. "
159952473, On On The Bright Side Moisturizer ,Nick,Normal,25-35," The product itself is great! I've used this for over a year now. I liked the older packaging, which was more like a squeeze tube. They recently created new packaging for it, which now seems to have way less within it, but somehow looks like there's way more than before.  "
159952473, On On The Bright Side Moisturizer ,Divya,Combination,18-24,"I do not like the packaging -- the pump only lets out very little at a time (which would be great for longevity), but if you use it on a daily basis, you'll probably run out quickly.  "
1250795, On Petite Bunny Gloss Bar ,athena,Dry,18-24," I like the pigment and the packaging is so cute, but I noticed my lips did feel quite dry after using this. I’d recommend using a different lip balm before using this, and adding this on top. "
1250795, On Petite Bunny Gloss Bar ,Nia,Dry,25-35," Whenever I""m rushing for work or to go out with friends, I just swipe some of this on and it makes it look more awake and like I actually did my makeup. Long lasting and not sticky at all. My absolute fave! "
1250795, On Petite Bunny Gloss Bar ,H,Sensitive,25-35," I have the angry red bunny and wish I could have gotten the pink one before it was discontinued! These give you the perfect wash of color and stay on for a long time. Plus, they're really cute! "
1250795, On Petite Bunny Gloss Bar ,Alex J.,Dry,25-35, Love a slight touch of color even though I’m a dude and makes my lips look uber soft 
1250795, On Petite Bunny Gloss Bar ,Elizabeth,Combination,25-35," Got the color juicy red - it gives a really nice subtle color. It looks natural and it's moisturizing. It is not long lasting and will easily wipe off with a napkin so reapplying is a must. But, for the price it's worth it. It's an affordable tinted lip balm that is worth the try. "
151131547, On Licorice pH Balancing Intensive Eye Cream ,Kaithleen H.,Combination,25-35, i haven’t seen any immediate drastic changes (2 week usage) but i like the texture it’s more of a cream than eye cream yet does not feel heavy for the area. i don’t have any complaints but not in a place to rave about it 
151131547, On Licorice pH Balancing Intensive Eye Cream ,Alexa,Oily,18-24," I noticed that my dark circles really haven’t gotten any better, but I haven’t found an eye cream that has done that for me yet. It definitely soothes the skin and reduces puffiness! "
151131547, On Licorice pH Balancing Intensive Eye Cream ,Sam R.,Combination,18-24, This goes on super light and immediately makes the space around your eyes very bright and glowing. I like to use this before I apply a retinol or bha in surrounding areas for extra protection and it really helps. A little goes a long way and it actually makes your eye areas feel super light and almost airy. It's a must-have. 
151131547, On Licorice pH Balancing Intensive Eye Cream ,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35, This is definitely my favorite eye cream. Goes on smoothly and is light but really does what it advertises! It’s moisturizing but the caffeine in it really does reduce swelling. I like to dab a little on my upper lids too just to help get red off the puffiness in the morning. Just be careful not to get in your eye- definitely stings! This is totally a holy grail though- I’ve put my sisters into it too!! 
151131547, On Licorice pH Balancing Intensive Eye Cream ,DAR,25-35,25-35," After using this several times, I can't say that it is particularly hydrating, however, it seals in other moisturizing products well. Texture is lovely. "
6950335, On 7-Day Sheet Mask Challenge Set ,Shien H.,Combination,45-55, I have been using these product for ages. It's really work. 
6950335, On 7-Day Sheet Mask Challenge Set ,Meghan,Dry,25-35, Really enjoyed these and feel they’re totally worth the money. One of my first sheet mask packs had a hydrogel mask and now I’m addicted to those! 
6950335, On 7-Day Sheet Mask Challenge Set ,Tess R.,Combination,25-35," I bought this as a gift set, but definitely kept some for myself. Great face masks for the price! "
6950335, On 7-Day Sheet Mask Challenge Set ,Airis,Combination,<18, Me and my friend have been using this mask set and let me tell you it’s definitely worth the money 
6950335, On 7-Day Sheet Mask Challenge Set ,neil,Oily,25-35, Such a great value to put in stocking for a skincare lover! 
170715667, On Revive Serum: Ginseng + Snail Mucin ,Ally,Sensitive,25-35," I love using this serum when my skin is stressed out or in need of some extra care. I have very sensitive / occasionally stressed out skin, and I find this serum really does help soothe and moisturize my skin! "
170715667, On Revive Serum: Ginseng + Snail Mucin ,Cindy C.,Sensitive,35-44, I was really hoping this brand and product would do wonders but it fell short. I'm not sure if it's a combination of what I'm using but I'll have to give it another try in a months time. 
170715667, On Revive Serum: Ginseng + Snail Mucin ,Ash,Normal,25-35," I'm totally sold on Beauty of Joseon at this point. I have bought this product twice, along with the Ginseng Water Essence. What an amazing pair they make together! My skin glows, looks great, feels soft and plump. I haven't had any unusual breakouts using this product, it goes on easy and absorbs fast! I honestly haven't been this attached to a serum before. "
170715667, On Revive Serum: Ginseng + Snail Mucin ,Na'ilah S.,Normal,25-35, Wished this came in a larger bottle because I like it so I’ll have to repurchase often. 
170715667, On Revive Serum: Ginseng + Snail Mucin ,Jocelyn,Normal,25-35," This product has got me sold on the Beauty of Joseon products. It's so soothing, especially after long days, and it has both ginseng and snail mucin, which are natural products great for the skin! I definitely will get this again! "
159952406, On A New Leaf Cream Cleanser ,Ricardo M.,Oily,<18, I have oily skin and despite being for dry/sensitive skin this really does a good job of cleaning my face without drying it out. It’s very non irritating and I’d recommend it as a generally safe buy 
159952406, On A New Leaf Cream Cleanser ,Amy J.,Combination,35-44, Sadly this face wash doesn't works for me. It dries my skin out and will starts to flake and look red. There is a lot of product left over so I'm using it as a body wash and like it so far. I'm giving this a 3 star because I love the texture and all the ingredients used in the product but it's just not for me. 
159952406, On A New Leaf Cream Cleanser ,esme m.,Combination,35-44,We are so sorry to hear this cleanser did not work out for you. Please reach out to us via e-mail with your order number and we'll be happy to get you all sorted! 
86244104, On Green Tea Fresh Toner ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," I liked this toner- I found it hydrating and a bit soothing. I just never really reached for it, and ended up giving it away after a few uses. "
86244104, On Green Tea Fresh Toner ,malissa,Oily,18-24, absolutely worth every penny!!! i have sensitive/acne prone skin so experimenting with different toners can be scary for me! i have absolutely no regrets with this toner! this helped control my redness and kept my oil production in check!! it does only have a subtle scent to it so it shouldn’t bother you if you’re sensitive to that :) 
86244104, On Green Tea Fresh Toner ,Carrie,Oily,25-35," I love all the ingredients and smells very pleasant, but I don't think it's a necessity to have in your skincare routine. "
86244104, On Green Tea Fresh Toner ,Stephanieh,Normal,18-24, I love this toner. I bought it originally at the beginning of this year and have repurchased this for a second time. It suits my normal skin type very well! There is a slight scent but I find it nice and it calms my skin well. 
86244104, On Green Tea Fresh Toner ,Sean,Combination,25-35, Super awesome hydrating toner that really evened out my skin tone. will definitely buy again 
23356603, On Annatto Hair Oil ,Jerlin H.,Sensitive,25-35, Great but price is high. Packaging looks amazing 
23356603, On Annatto Hair Oil ,Grace K.,Normal,25-35," Love, love, love this for my hair. The best hair oil I've ever used. I have short hair, so one bottle can last me a whole year. Worth it, even at the price. "
23356603, On Annatto Hair Oil ,Daniel,Dry,18-24, Not too greasy and gives shine and a silky texture to my hair. The scent isn’t too strong and it keeps my hair moisturized throughout the day. 
23356603, On Annatto Hair Oil ,Bridget,Sensitive,25-35," I have tried many hair oils, and I can confidently say that I will NEVER be without this product again. The scent is lovely. The shine is incredible. This multipurpose oil tames frizz when I wear my hair in its natural curls, and it can also smooth and extend the life of a blowout. Holy grail. "
23356603, On Annatto Hair Oil ,DAR,25-35,25-35," I've tried other hair oils (to save money) but I keep coming back to this one. It lasts a while and maintains my hair better than anything else I've tried. My hair is quick to both take in and lose moisture, so I moisturize and then seal it all in with this oil. It doesn't leave my hair looking greasy whether applied damp or dry. The scent is pleasant and dissipates quickly. "
3841317, On 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine Set (Combination Skin Type) ,Ava,Sensitive,18-24," Thanks for this $200 bundle deal, I was able to really get involved in my own skincare routine and actually have a point to start at. Everything in this bundle helped even out my skin. I gave me things I needed repair in and also gentle ingredients to start you off with. All in all its a great way to start in the skin care journey. "
3841317, On 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine Set (Combination Skin Type) ,Megan G.,Combination,18-24, my package was supposed to be delivered on the 31st of March and i got it 10 days after it shipped!! It was such a nice surprise as was the two freebies i got in my package! my skin already feels and looks better and i am so happy i decided to go through sokoglam!!! 
3841317, On 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine Set (Combination Skin Type) ,Janelle,Combination,18-24," I've bought skincare from SokoGlam since 2016, I love their products. I typically buy oily skincare sets. This time I decided to try a combo skin set because not all of my face is oily, and some spots are sensitive/prone to redness. This set it great EXCEPT for the toner. It feels like acid on my skin. I've only used it twice. I don't blame SokoGlam for this, but I would like a recommendation to a different toner that could work with this set considering I spent over $200. So, if you have sensitive skin, or skin that just isn't tough, this toner will take you out! "
3841317, On 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine Set (Combination Skin Type) ,Shierly,Combination,18-24, I've bough the 10 steps skin care in this online shop 2/ 3 years ago and it works like magic. That's why i want to buy it again. But after i got the sets now the toner is not good for a people with sensitive skin. Whole of my face is red after the 4th days.  
3841317, On 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine Set (Combination Skin Type) ,Carter p.,Combination,18-24,I wouldn't reccomend to buy this sets if you have sensitive skins like mind. The rest is fine just the toner doesn't work with me. 
217815790, On Ginseng Essence Water ,Aeris,Dry,18-24, Really loved this toner. New to k beatuy but it’s my new go to 
217815790, On Ginseng Essence Water ,Carrie,Dry,35-44," I purchased this on a whim and thought I would give it a go. I've been using it over the last few months and have definitely noticed a difference. The redness that I normally have due to rosacea is not there anymore, my skin is noticeably brighter, and it is definitely more hydrated. I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try it. It's now being added to my rotation permanently. "
217815790, On Ginseng Essence Water ,Ash,Normal,25-35," I never really liked water essences, but this one changed my mind. I only need 3 drops in the palm of my hand and can easily pat it on without half the liquid dripping away on me. I've bought this twice now I like it so much. I pair it with the Ginseng Snail Serum. My skin looks and feels amazing. It hasn't caused any breakouts. Absorbs quickly. Definitely makes your face feel moisturized even before using moisturizer! "
217815790, On Ginseng Essence Water ,Na'ilah S.,Normal,25-35, I heard good things about beauty of Joseon products. And so far so good. 
217815790, On Ginseng Essence Water ,Nicole W.,Combination,35-44, Love it! 
136923297, On Resveratrol 345NA_Intensive Repair Cream ,Ally,Sensitive,25-35," I’m always on the look-out for my next go-to moisturizer, and this one will never leave my collection! You really can’t go wrong with this moisturizer. You can feel the hydration and it working as soon as you apply it, but its not heavy. Would definitely recommend! "
136923297, On Resveratrol 345NA_Intensive Repair Cream ,Lili,Sensitive,25-35," I'm only a few weeks with this cream and have been using it as a day moisturizer. It smells so good (I know many are averse to fragrance for allergen reasons, but I have very sensitive skin and this seems so be so gentle and not bothersome so far) and is incredibly soothing to apply. It also absorbs well- I put it on after cleansing and toning, and then follow with neogen sunscreen and a ccc cream from CLE. Altogether it gives my skin a dewy and supple look, and helps fight the dry air of New England winter. I recommend for anyone with dry skin who doesn't have to worry about fragrance! "
136923297, On Resveratrol 345NA_Intensive Repair Cream ,Olivia,Normal,25-35, Im on my second tube of this. Very lightly fragranted! It’s a very moisturizing gel/cream that doesn’t make me feel oily. It sinks in very well and just feels lovely! I have sensitive skin and this does not make me break out. 
136923297, On Resveratrol 345NA_Intensive Repair Cream ,Cassandra C.,Dry,25-35, I have dry skin and in the winter my face would flake and get red everywhere. Starting this I can say my skin is no longer those thing but soft. 
136923297, On Resveratrol 345NA_Intensive Repair Cream ,DeeDee H.,Combination,25-35," Goes on smooth and doesn't feel oily or thick. Rich and creamy, doesn't take much to moisturize. Love it! "
20067260, On Acne + Sebum Controlling Sheet Mask Set ,Bobo,Combination,18-24," RUN, do not WALK, to order these. These are amazing! "
20067260, On Acne + Sebum Controlling Sheet Mask Set ,Eileen,Combination,18-24," I ordered these simply because of the fact I didn't know what to start with and I do have lots of acne, acne scars, and sebum production, and when I tell you to run, and not walk, to order this set, you run! My face has been clearing up a lot more and my self-confidence is sky rocketing. Just remember that consistency is key as well. Sheet masks alone won't help. "
20067260, On Acne + Sebum Controlling Sheet Mask Set ,Michelle S.,Combination,45-55, I prefer to purchase sheet mask variety sets like this one and use one sheet each week. I’ll continue to buy this over and over. 
20067260, On Acne + Sebum Controlling Sheet Mask Set ,sun l.,Combination,25-35," It has always been fun to order these and try out different masks---I ended up finding the most effective one for me through this set, and ordered it separately (it is the Goodbye Redness Centella Pack). I highly recommend this if you are looking to test out different masks and want a curated set that helps with acne/sebum control! "
20067260, On Acne + Sebum Controlling Sheet Mask Set ,Kate H.,Oily,18-24," Great selection, not just exfoliating masks but calming as well. I love not having to go through and choose what to order! "
105214048, On Snail Bee Ultimate Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Julie,Sensitive,25-35, I have used these for awhile now. I have combination sensitive skin with both eczema and rosacea. 
105214048, On Snail Bee Ultimate Hydrogel Eye Patch ,KD,Sensitive,35-44,"Pros: lots of serum, comes with tweezers (originally it came with a spatula but the tweezers are way easier), lots of masks so you can use it more consistently.  "
105214048, On Snail Bee Ultimate Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Kelsey,Dry,18-24,"Cons: super slippery so it slides down the face, if you have rosacea then note that I get reactive redness from these but the redness does go away.  "
34299041, On SoonJung 10 Free Moist Emulsion ,Ivana,Dry,18-24," I have extremely dry skin and have been trying so many moisturizers. This is the only one that works for me and is extremely good for sensitive skin. Love the light feeling. Absolute best product, have repurchased over and over again "
34299041, On SoonJung 10 Free Moist Emulsion ,Sara,Sensitive,35-44, I’ve been using the Soon Jung moisturizer for a few years now but my boyfriend recently tried it and was shocked at how light it was while still moisturizing. He emptied that bottle pretty quickly and I bought him a drugstore brand to replace it but he would not even use it after one try. He is a soko convert now so I stocked up for him. We love this line. 
34299041, On SoonJung 10 Free Moist Emulsion ,Amelia,Combination,18-24," after much trials, and way too many errors, i always come back to this moisturizer. i use it as a day time moisturizer. i have combination skin and it never feels too thick or heavy, it's pretty lightweight and i appreciate the way it easily glides and emuslifies into my skin "
34299041, On SoonJung 10 Free Moist Emulsion ,Candice B.,Sensitive,25-35, Love that it's lightweight and non greasy. It's hard to find something that hydrates my skin and doesn't exacerbate any other issues my skin might be having so I'm glad I found this. 
34299041, On SoonJung 10 Free Moist Emulsion ,Jaina,Normal,<18," This is incredible for my skin, I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin!!! And I'm so happy I have this, my skin looks and feels great! "
214969931, On Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask ,Kiki,Normal,25-35," This product singlehandedly makes me want to incorporate an exclusive Saturday Skin regimen. This product hydrates and nourishes my face without the Vitamin C overload that I tend to get from using straight-up serums. Once I finish with the current serum I'm using, it's back to this!! "
214969931, On Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask ,S.Y.,Combination,25-35, My skin has been so dry this winter. This has my skin feeling super soft and refreshed when I wake up. 
214969931, On Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask ,Min J.,Dry,25-35, My skin: Dry / dull / sensitive. 
214969931, On Yuzu Vitamin C Sleep Mask ,sk,Combination,18-24,Using this mask amplifies my moisturizer and brightens my face. It slightly lessens the sensitivity of my face. My face is softer the next morning and even have a dewy look in the morning which is nice considering I've always had dry skin that needs fortifying. Not sticky either!  
2937651, On Waterproof Pen Liner ,Janet H.,Dry,>55," love the brush on this liner, it is so controllable, since i like a fine line. However, even though it’s waterproof, it still fades over the course of a few hours, and needs to be re-applied. Unfortunately, I rarely get the opportunity to do that. "
2937651, On Waterproof Pen Liner ,Anne R.,Oily,18-24," this was fine the first few uses, but sooner or later it doesn't come off as completely black. in fact, you can see streak marks where it's drawn on because the product isn't opaque at all. it's also prone to smearing throughout the day, which isn't ideal for those with monolids or asian eyes in general. "
2937651, On Waterproof Pen Liner ,alyssa,Combination,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare and makeup is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this pen liner did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your preferences:) "
80494774, On Goodbye Redness Centella Mask Pack ,SooIn Y.,Combination,25-35," I do a mask occasionally at night when my skin feels rough, and can actually see reduced redness the next morning. "
80494774, On Goodbye Redness Centella Mask Pack ,Mui C.,Combination,45-55, I really like these mask as I have rosecea and this mask really helped reduce the redness. It also makes my face really smooth. 
80494774, On Goodbye Redness Centella Mask Pack ,Joan R.,Dry,55+, Sometimes I have mild eczema and this mask helps soothe my skin. 
80494774, On Goodbye Redness Centella Mask Pack ,Starlet,Sensitive,35-44, So my skin has been a little crazy because I stopped using over the counter hydrocortisone cream. And although i’ve been keeping my skin moisturized and vaseline has helped this mask has helped the most. I kept them in the fridge and used one as part of my night routine and my skin is calm and feels amaziiiiiiiiing. Keeping these handy! 
80494774, On Goodbye Redness Centella Mask Pack ,nikki m.,Dry,18-24, Smoothes skin and bumps with only one use. 
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Remy,Oily,35-44," I really like this cleanser and highly recommend it. The bottle automatically foams the cleanser as you pump it out and one pump on a silicone facial cleansing pad is more than enough even after a long sweaty and oily skin day. The smell is light and pleasing and the foaming very lovely and rich with a wonderfully nice lather. This was the first time I used a foaming facial cleanser and this cleanser has converted me. I can't imagine going back to a regular non-foaming cleaner. Although the bottle is small it lasts forever, one bottle lasted me 4 months, and I ended up appreciating the size of the bottle, it is small so you can take it traveling as well, very convenient! It leaves skin feeling clean without drying and I noticed an improvement in my skin with fewer pimples after 2 weeks of using this cleanser. "
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Emily,Sensitive,25-35, Absolutely love this wash! The scent is incredible- smells like eucalyptus without burning your skin at all. Very refreshing! I don’t use the whole pump and my skin feels fresh every time. 
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,neil,Oily,25-35, So I have been using this cleanser for a couple of months now. I was looking for something that wouldn't excessively dry out my skin after use. This fits the bill. It is gentle and after using it my skin feels great and not dry and tight.  
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Bunny,Oily,18-24,The only thing i wish is it was a little bigger so it could last me longer. 
10532821, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Revitalizing ,Rosana,Combination,18-24, It is nice as a first step cleanser but it does not take the makeup off as well as the original (mainly waterproof mascara) it was a bit harder. 
10532821, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Revitalizing ,Mr. B.,Combination,35-44," Love the scent. I always double cleanse, never makes my skin feel dry "
10532821, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Revitalizing ,Katie,Combination,25-35," I've been using the original for years and got this as a free gift. I think I like this even more! This seems to be better suited for my skin type (dehydrated oily), evening out my oiliness and leaving my skin smooth after cleansing. The product description says it smells like roses, but I think it has more of a tropical scent (almost like banana?). "
10532821, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Revitalizing ,Chika A.,Combination,25-35, I love this product and use it religiously! It really gets deep in my pores and breaks down the dirt and oil on my face from the day. This allows me to use a little less toner after washing my face which is a plus if your toner is pricey. A staple skincare product in my routine! 
34299042, On SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser ,Valeria,Dry,18-24," Definitely one of my favorite cleansers, I end up going back to this after trying other ones. Great for dry/sensitive skin! "
34299042, On SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser ,Nakea,Dry,25-35," I like this cleanser because its gentle, effective and not overly stripping compared to other cleansers. My skin does feel dry after using it so you'll need a very hydrating routine to follow up with. Its great for removing stubborn makeup/residue that my balm cleanser left behind. This may be better in the summer when my skin leans more combo/oily. "
34299042, On SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser ,Ruth,Sensitive,25-35, I love this cleanser. It is super gentle on my skin and doesn’t leave me feeling like my skin is dried out. 
34299042, On SoonJung pH 6.5 Whip Cleanser ,Grace K.,Combination,35-44, This foaming cleanser is gentle and great for sensitive skin! 
80494685, On PibuWang Mask - REST (5pack) ,Aly,Combination,18-24," One of the best sheet masks I have ever purchased -hands down. Fits comfortably, extremely soothing/hydrating and had a noticeable difference upon using. Good for when your skin is dehydrated or needs a pick me up! Love that there is some leftover essence in the bag, save it!! "
80494685, On PibuWang Mask - REST (5pack) ,Kelsey,Normal,25-35," I have bought these a couple times now and it continues to be a go to face mask. Refreshing, the scent is just right, and overall what I want for a relaxing spa time at home. "
80494685, On PibuWang Mask - REST (5pack) ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," Aside from having super cute packaging, these are perfect for my sensitive skin and feel so nice! I use any left over essence in the packaging on my neck and chest, don’t waste it! Yah they’re a tad pricier than some other masks, but unlike a lot of those these don’t overwhelm me with fragrance or sting my face. And tbh they hydrate my skin enough to make it worth it "
80494685, On PibuWang Mask - REST (5pack) ,Samantha,Sensitive,18-24," I'm obsessed!!! I have tried multiple sheet masks before and only noticed slight changes but with this mask, I can see and have received compliments on my skin after using this mask. The scent isn't strong and the size of the mask is perfect. "
80494685, On PibuWang Mask - REST (5pack) ,Celia M.,Dry,55+, It’s lovely. Will incorporate this into my skin care regimen now. 
112573916, On D.N.A Hydrating Protein Sheet Mask ,Jennifer S.,Combination,35-44, I first tried the Mediheal variety box set of masks. This one I enjoy most for winter dryness. I am alternating these with their tea tree masks (help with redness and acne) so my face is calm and hydrated. Keeps my skills looking flawless. My forehead lines stay away with hydration 
112573916, On D.N.A Hydrating Protein Sheet Mask ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," These masks definitely do their job well, they leave my skin super hydrated! the fragrance is a little overwhelming for me personally, but it does smell like fresh-out-of-the-shower clean so I’m sure there are others who would love it. "
112573916, On D.N.A Hydrating Protein Sheet Mask ,Colene W.,Dry,35-44," Absolutely adore these masks! I can't give info on long-term results because I just started using them, but I can tell you I understand why they always get such good reviews. When I first opened the mask, I thought they'd leave a sticky after feeling, but not at all. The thick serum absorbs very quickly, and the sheet itself is so soft! I actually even saved a little of the serum to use up later. My skin was so plump and soft! Will definitely continue to use these masks and will purchase more in the future. The price is very reasonable for what you're getting. "
112573916, On D.N.A Hydrating Protein Sheet Mask ,Tie,Sensitive,25-35," My skin is super sensitive and these were perfect, did not irritate my skin at all. "
155746111, On Sun Project Water Sun Cream ,Jinah,Normal,35-44, I use this sunscreen everyday because it protects my face and is super moisturizing but not oily. 
155746111, On Sun Project Water Sun Cream ,Waneda O.,Combination,35-44," This is a great suncream, does on nice and the packaging is cute. I feel it is also hydrating. "
155746111, On Sun Project Water Sun Cream ,Gretchen G.,Combination,35-44," It has a fragrance and isn't mineral-based only, which I was hoping for, but it goes on smoothly and leaves my skin soft, not tacky or sticky. The fragrance is more of a perfume than the usual sunscreen scents. "
155746111, On Sun Project Water Sun Cream ,Manasi I.,Oily,25-35, It applied so nicely and I really loved the texture. Unfortunately it made my skin break out into hives and start to flake off. Probably not for sensitive skin. 
38110748, On A-Thera Cleansing Foam ,Ana A.,Oily,25-35," I bought this cleanser because I had seen good reviews for oily skin. But after trying it for a couple weeks I found it made me break out more than I would before. At first it didn't make my skin feel too stripped or dry, quite the opposite. It would feel very moisturized and almost oily? But afterwards it would feel like too much oil on my face. So I don't think this cleanser is for me. "
38110748, On A-Thera Cleansing Foam ,Gracie,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
38110748, On A-Thera Cleansing Foam ,Tamara,Normal,18-24, Still too early to tell how it’s affecting my skin but I LOVE the smell and how clean my face feels after using it! 
38110748, On A-Thera Cleansing Foam ,Seraphina,Combination,<18," This is my favorite cleanser in the entire world, the first thing I noticed was that it was so CREAMY and who doesn't like a good creamy product and it went on my face nicely, a little goes a long way. The first time I used it, it cleansed my face very well (it is a deep cleanser) and my face felt smoother than it was ever before. It's not drying, its just right. 10/10 will buy again, Also! The smell is a very hotel soap smell, its very light. It reminds me of hotel soap lol "
236163250, On Rice Toner ,Tiffany,Dry,No," Very gentle and hydrating toner. My skin is usually quite sensitive, but I didn't get any redness after using this product. I will say I didn't notice any long-term benefits nor does this keep me hydrated for a long amount of time. "
236163250, On Rice Toner ,Elba,No,25-35," I absolutely adore this toner. I’m on my third bottle already. It hydrates, brightens and I can definitely see oil reduction on my tzone from it. I’ve tried so many different toners and I keep coming back for this one every time because it’s just that good. Also you get a good amount of product so it’ll last you for a while. "
236163250, On Rice Toner ,Kathleen V.,25-35,Combination," I have eczema prone, sensitive skin so I’m wary about new products. This is amazing. My skin drinks this up! So hydrating and nourishing! "
236163250, On Rice Toner ,Kat,Combination,No, I think it works great! I definitely will be getting this again 
236163250, On Rice Toner ,Lauren W.,No,25-35, This toner makes my skin glow! I love how milky and hydrating it is. I notice a big difference when I skip using this toner. 
36315502, On Fermentation Eye Cream ,El.,Combination,25-35," I was worried how my skin might react to this but it is very hydrating and didn't irritate my sensitive skin! It's not going to reverse age you 10 years (nothing will) but I do feel like my under eyes are brighter and more hydrated. The skin around my eyes gets irritated so easily, but after using the whole tube of this product I feel like the skin around my eyes is stronger than before. My eye area can handle more of a beating when it comes to eye makeup and feels a little healthier. This melts into my skin and doesn't leave a sticky film which is a huge plus for me. This is a very good eye cream, it's vegan, and it comes with a lot of product in the tube. A great addition to my daily routine! I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you've had your eye on this! "
36315502, On Fermentation Eye Cream ,Elba,Combination,25-35," The ingredients list of this eye cream are top tier which is why I purchased it. I’ve also had friends that are obsessed with this but unfortunately it’s just not for me. I didn’t really enjoy the consistency of it, it irritated my eyes and unfortunately it triggered my milia. Just not for me. "
36315502, On Fermentation Eye Cream ,Anna N.,Normal,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
34815663, On Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cleansing Foam ,Jinah,Normal,35-44, This is a great gentle and foaming cleanser that will remove all your makeup! 
34815663, On Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cleansing Foam ,Madison D.,Combination,35-44, This cleanser seriously is great. This really helps settle my acne when it’s Hormonal and keeps most big blemishes away when it’s not hormonal acne. The snail stuff I think is what helps. My skin feels soft and to me seems more clear since I’ve started using it. On my third bottle now :). 
34815663, On Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cleansing Foam ,Ann S.,Oily,25-35, Smells good and gentle on the skin 
34815663, On Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cleansing Foam ,Kenneth W.,Oily,45-55, Nice foaming cleanser. Feels great on the skin after washed off. Likely will be my go to water based foaming cleanser going forward. 
49735559, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Nourishing ,Charlene H.,Dry,>55, It not as good as the pink one but it nice it does melt I your skin and cleanse any makeup but I think the pink is better for my skin 
49735559, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Nourishing ,Kristina,Combination,35-44," While I don’t see this version different than the others, I enjoy using and it’s great to get makeup off. Good scent and great size that will last awhile, especially if you only use when you wear makeup sporadically like I do :) "
49735559, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Nourishing ,Sarah S.,Dry,35-44, This takes off my makeup wonderfully without drying me out even if my skin is already stressed and irritated 
49735559, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Nourishing ,SDB,Dry,35-44," I feel like I'm probably in the minority, but this really dried my skin out! I used it from late spring until mid-Aug and found myself having to moisturize like it was mid-winter. Normally, I don't have as many issues with dryness in the summer months. I'm pretty certain that the issue stemmed from this, as it was the only variant/new product in my routine. I used it up, so I feel like I gave it enough time - just wasn't for me! As soon as I moved a different product into the cleansing oil/balm step, my skin was back to normal. It's not awful or anything, just maybe not for every type of dry skin! "
161994571, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Moisture Cream ,Gabbi,Combination,25-35, Love this moisturizer - just wish that there was more product as I go through it so quickly! 
161994571, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Moisture Cream ,Rumi,Combination,25-35," can’t say enough good things about this moisturizer! at first it seems really heavy when you apply it on your skin, but its actual perfect. it’s hydrating, not greasy or oily, and doesn’t cause my skin to breakout. i use this as my daily moisturizer and my skin has never been better! "
161994571, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Moisture Cream ,Amanda W.,Sensitive,18-24," Using this first thing in the morning, it plumps up the skin well. It looks and feels hydrating. However, throughout the day, it seems to be sitting on top of the skin rather than have soaked in. I had it on for a full day at home without makeup and broke out with tiny white heads everywhere. My skin also felt greasy and it felt like there was a thin layer of the product still sitting on my face. I was hoping for a lightweight hydrating moisturizer, but this unfortunately is not it. "
15440708, On BB Creme Au Ginseng ,Raynel,Combination,45-55," I really loved the way this looked and felt on my skin, although, there was a little more coverage than I usually prefer. I personally cannot use it because I had a reaction where my eyes watered constantly while wearing it, but as soon as I cleansed my face my eyes stop watering. I hope this doesn’t detour anyone from at least trying it. "
15440708, On BB Creme Au Ginseng ,Danielle D.,Combination,45-55, Surprisingly it matches my skin color which I was little worried about being a brown buying a non-brown geared foundation product. Blends nicely 
15440708, On BB Creme Au Ginseng ,Maria B.,Combination,18-24, I was already a lover of the CC cream and the BB did not disappoint. This goes on the skin very smoothly and leaves you with a nice matte finish. Covers just enough to make you feel put together without any cakey-ness. 
15440708, On BB Creme Au Ginseng ,Rachel C.,Combination,25-35," I have been using tinted moisturizers for years and was so glad to find KBeauty version.. but even better! Really great coverage and does not feel heavy. My only issue is that the Clair colour is still a bit darker than what I would prefer and there are no lighter shades, which is unfortunate. All in all - happy with my purchase! "
15440708, On BB Creme Au Ginseng ,Katlyn Z.,Combination,25-35," This is my first time trying a BB cream with a velvet finish. I am more of a light-medium cool skintone and I was worried the light color would be too light for me, but it ended up blending and adjusting nicely. Finish is velvet as described and does a good job with pore blurring. 4 stars because I am still getting used to the finish but everything else is great. "
80494778, On Radiance Cleansing Balm ,Sai,Dry,25-35," Great value for money, small amount goes a long way "
80494778, On Radiance Cleansing Balm ,JessB,Combination,35-44," I had tried this oil cleanser several years ago before it was reformulated and liked it, but this new version does not agree with my skin. My skin instantly turned a deep red when I applied and it stayed red for a while after removing it. My skin felt extremely dry and tight. I love Soko Glam though, they have an amazing return policy which allows me to try different products. My skin is very reactive and sensitive these days so it's been hard finding a balance. "
80494778, On Radiance Cleansing Balm ,sara s.,Dry,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
80494778, On Radiance Cleansing Balm ,Dorine C.,Combination,18-24," I have dry and sensitive skin with a number of allergies (including soy), so I was a little apprehensive when I saw that this had a soy derived ingredient in it - soybean ferment extract - while I know that the allergic reaction is triggered by proteins in soy, I was unsure if the proteins made it through that extraction process, or if they would be in a significant enough dose to trigger a reaction. I'm pleased to say that I have had no troubles! I should note that my allergy is moderate (hives and eczema rather than anaphylactic shock, even to expeller-pressed soybean oil). My face is soft and clean and the balm has no drying effect. I miss the smell of the Commleaf Green balm I had been using before, but this one is doing more for my skin, so it wins. It's also way cheaper! "
222559637, On Lotus Water Cream ,Joy M.,Combination,35-44, Light cream for everyday use. 
222559637, On Lotus Water Cream ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," At first, I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I liked that it felt lightweight, but still hydrated nicely. However, the more I used it, the less I liked it. It just didn't do enough for my skin for me to repurchase. It ended up not being hydrating enough in the end. "
222559637, On Lotus Water Cream ,Ariana,Sensitive,18-24," This didn't work for my dry and acne-prone skin, I used it every day for 3 weeks and consistently broke out. Too lightweight and did not help to moisturize my skin. "
222559637, On Lotus Water Cream ,nev,Combination,35-44, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
104208404, On Galactomyces Pure Vitamin C Glow Serum ,Alexus,Combination,18-24," I bought this along with the matching toner because one of the main issues with my skin was my uneven skin tone. I had white splotches on my forehead that really bothered me. This set did my skin wonders even though I have trouble with being super consistent with my skincare routine. I don't even see the white splotches anymore and of course, it helped with the rest of my face too! 10/10 totally recommend! "
104208404, On Galactomyces Pure Vitamin C Glow Serum ,Gosia,Oily,35-44," This serum is my newest purchase, but it didn't give my skin glowing effect like I would like. "
104208404, On Galactomyces Pure Vitamin C Glow Serum ,Filufilu,Oily,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback!

188438742, On Licorice pH Balancing Advance Serum ,Rachel C.,Combination,25-35, Though I like the ingredients in this serum. I find that it is not as effective at reducing my PIH as well as the toner. My niacinamide serum works faster and better than this serum too. 
188438742, On Licorice pH Balancing Advance Serum ,Cindy C.,Sensitive,35-44, I've realized that this brand rocks!! Works great with my skin type so I'll be back for more. 
188438742, On Licorice pH Balancing Advance Serum ,Solveig,Combination,25-35," I received this serum in a trial kit for the lunar new year promotion along with the acwell toner and eye cream, and I have to say this product is so wonderful. The toner is refreshing, the serum is light and soft. For reference, I have combination-type skin and my skin has a hard time absorbing products. This product was easy for my skin to absorb and did not make it feel goopy as sometimes happens with other serums and oils. I paired this serum with the acwell toner, eye-cream and the hanskin calming essence, and I think that combination is so wonderful. I definitely want to purchase the full products! "
188438742, On Licorice pH Balancing Advance Serum ,Kiran K.,Combination,25-35," I’ve actually seen a difference in my skin with this serum. I have acne scars and I kid you not, they were fading and my overall face was brighter and had glow! "
188438742, On Licorice pH Balancing Advance Serum ,JESSICA V.,Normal,35-44, I have been using this product for a few months new along with the matching toner and have been so pleased with how my skin looks and feels. Smoothing and nourishing. 
114407046, On Fermentation Peptine Eye Care Cream ,Simona R.,Combination,35-44, I had high expectations for this but unfortunately it is not nourishing enough. My skin feels dry through the day. I put it in at night and the next morning my skin does not not feel fresh or moist. 
114407046, On Fermentation Peptine Eye Care Cream ,Crystal S.,Combination,25-35," I have fairly sensitive combination skin, and this strikes a good balance between anti-aging and moisturizing without being too heavy. "
114407046, On Fermentation Peptine Eye Care Cream ,Stephanie D.,Combination,25-35," I didn't have major issues with my eyes - no puffiness, no dark circles, only a little bit of fine lines. But with fine lines, I do see improvement after using this for a couple of weeks! I will stick with this and consider this more of a preventative measure so that I can age as well as possible :) "
114407046, On Fermentation Peptine Eye Care Cream ,Dustin G.,Normal,45-55," This one just did not work for me. Felt slightly irritating on my eye area skin and some days actually seemed to reduce the look of them some days and on the other days showed no improvement. I don't think there's anything wrong with the product, just a bad match for me. "
114407046, On Fermentation Peptine Eye Care Cream ,Celia H.,Combination,18-24," I'm pretty young, but I have wrinkles and fine lines under my eyes because of bad habits as a child. Before this, I had trouble with almost every eye cream- I just didn't get results with any of them and wasted a lot of money. But this worked! I've been using this for just 2 weeks and my fine lines are already much better. "
33453797, On Green Pearlsation Tea Tree Care Body Spray ,Clariza,Combination,25-35," I have back acne and I did not notice any difference this product made. It's really light, and leaves no residue on the skin which is nice.... but it wasn't effective. I was better off using snail mucin and moisturizer on my back. "
33453797, On Green Pearlsation Tea Tree Care Body Spray ,neil,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences "
33453797, On Green Pearlsation Tea Tree Care Body Spray ,caitlin,Normal,18-24, It's hard to know whether this product really made a difference in my skin. What I can say is it smelled good and was refreshing on my skin. It was also more convenient to use than serums or toners would be. It also lasted a long time without losing it's integrity. 
38139051, On A-Thera Cream ,Jessica H.,Combination,25-35, Love the smooth texture and how it feels on my skin. 
38139051, On A-Thera Cream ,sol p.,Sensitive,18-24, Just bought this moisturizer. A good summer option for sensible acne prone skin 
38139051, On A-Thera Cream ,Beth,Combination,25-35," I have been using this product for over 2 years now. It has been a life saver! I use this after toning, essence, and moisturizing in the morning. Once it’s dry, I go about my normal makeup routine. It helps keep my acne away even while wearing makeup, sweating, and being in various environments. "
38139051, On A-Thera Cream ,Lauren K.,Combination,25-35,"It feels like a cool gel when it comes out, but then turns tacky once it starts to dry; let it sit for a few minutes, and it will soak into your skin. "
79951408, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Essence Water ,Samantha E.,Combination,35-44," I was looking for a snail essence and this one was highly rated everywhere. I love how soft it's made my skin especially since I use it as my 1st step after cleansing. It reminds me of Nature Republic's skin booster & emulsion, but 1000x better. As a licensed esthetician, I approve! "
79951408, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Essence Water ,Nicole H.,Dry,35-44, I really like how this makes my skin feel afterwards. 
79951408, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Essence Water ,Emily B.,Oily,25-35," I use this morning and evening on a cotton round in lieu of an eye cream (my oily skin can't handle eye creams). It's incredibly hydrating and is doing wonders for keeping ageing at bay. There is fragrance, but it's very subtle and goes away almost immediately. IMO, better than CosRX's similar product. I absolutely love this product and will absolutely continue to repurchase. "
79951408, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Essence Water ,Jacky G.,Combination,<18, It smells nice and gives my face a nice glow ✨ 
79951408, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Essence Water ,Evan P.,Sensitive,18-24, Idk why snail mucin and my skin just don’t agree ! Tried this one and cosrx and causes major irritation 
247070453, On Snail Mucin Energy Essence ,Joleena M.,Sensitive,No," love this product so far. my skin is very dry and sensitive and so far, my skin has never felt more hydrated and bright than now. i can feel the difference. "
247070453, On Snail Mucin Energy Essence ,Priyanka,No,18-24," I've recently started on a more serious skin regimen and have been using this as a part of it, and I enjoy it a lot! It's definitely noted a difference in skin texture, and has made a huge difference to my skin's condition. "
247070453, On Snail Mucin Energy Essence ,Brenna,25-35,Dry," If I could only pick one skin ingredient to use, it would be snail mucin. It is hydrating, and so comforting on my skin. I use it as a moisturizing serum, but it also helps with my skin texture as I am at the lucky age where I am fighting wrinkles AND breakouts. It provides a beautiful glow without getting sticky and layers well with others. I was using a different brand of snail mucin and when I went to restock it was sold out so I got this insead. This one is an even better price and my skin loves it. I use this daily - its very thin so it's suitable under heavier serums and moisturizers. I also love to put this on right after I use an exfoliating mask because it is so soothing and hydrating. "
247070453, On Snail Mucin Energy Essence ,Jp,Combination,No, I wouldn’t say this is a fave for me but I do feel it’s kinda hydrating for my skin and it’s not irritating at all so that is nice 
237465517, On Cosmic Dew Water Cleanser ,Raleigh,Combination,35-44," I liked this but won’t reorder. Cleaned my skin decently, but I was left feeling so striped after. I have dry patches on my forehead at the end of the day if I use it in the morning. No scent which is nice but not super impressed. "
237465517, On Cosmic Dew Water Cleanser ,Eva P.,Normal,45-55,Thanks for your feedback!  
208708098, On Real Ferment Micro Mist ,Wanda,Combination,No," Really tried to like this one and give it a chance. Might just be my skin, but this product really broke me out, even after consistently using it for about 4 months. Previous to using this product, i'd occasionally have hormonal break outs, but i was having pimples pretty much all the time with this product (painful too!). I finally just didn't think the break outs were worth it. :/ "
208708098, On Real Ferment Micro Mist ,hillary,No,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
208708098, On Real Ferment Micro Mist ,Elizabeth S.,25-35,Combination, Very moisturizing and good for sensitive skin! I spray it on during the day and it keeps my skin hydrated. Also like the packaging. 
112574000, On W.H.P Brightening & Hydrating Charcoal Sheet Mask ,Julia J.,Combination,25-35, So far I’ve tried 3 of the 5 and I can say afterwards my face is very hydrated. I haven’t noticed an increase in brightness yet but it does mention to wait until skin cell turnover by using 2-3 times a week for 4 weeks. I can’t wait to see the results. 
112574000, On W.H.P Brightening & Hydrating Charcoal Sheet Mask ,KSF,Oily,35-44, These mask are great. The material is soft and comfortable. The mask for my face well. Lots of serum. Skin looks bright and glowing after using. Will definitely repurchase. 
112574000, On W.H.P Brightening & Hydrating Charcoal Sheet Mask ,K.K.,35-44,35-44," If I have time before I head out, I like to use these to prep my skin. They make me a little brighter and provide adequate moisture. I definitely little or no dry spots after a long day, when I usually would have some had I not used this mask. "
112574000, On W.H.P Brightening & Hydrating Charcoal Sheet Mask ,S.S,Combination,<18, I love how my skin feels after using these sheet masks and the feeling would be even better if you put it a little bit in the refrigerator before using. 
237466173, On Moon Glow Milky Toning Lotion ,Jennifer S.,Sensitive,35-44, I have very reactive sensitive skin. So far I’ve had no reaction to this & that alone keeps me happy 
237466173, On Moon Glow Milky Toning Lotion ,Aly,Combination,18-24," Was very excited to try this product, and it exceeded my expectations! Melts right into the skin and gives an amazingg plump ""glow from within"" look. Upon using day/night for about 2 weeks, I noticed my skin was a lot smoother and no longer dehydrated. Also love the ingredient list, wish they would make a bigger size!! Would purchase again. "
237466173, On Moon Glow Milky Toning Lotion ,Ari P.,Combination,25-35, Not the product's fault but I'm weird about smells. The texture is nice but I don't notice it does anything different than any other toners I've tried. Middle of the road for me. 
7345209, On Snail Bee High Content Skin ,sarah l.,Dry,18-24, works so great for my skin 
7345209, On Snail Bee High Content Skin ,sarah,Dry,18-24, great hydration for all skin types and literally overnight helped a breakout i was having . a must 
7345209, On Snail Bee High Content Skin ,Katie W.,Combination,18-24, I’ve loved this product ever since I got it last Christmas. It always feels very lightweight and refreshing on my skin after washing my face. 
7345209, On Snail Bee High Content Skin ,Helen K.,Combination,35-44," I recently started changing up my routine this summer. I only tried some cheap drug-store type toner once (returned it) and didn't really ""get it."" Well, after the skin consult on Soko Glam, they recommended the Snail Bee toner. I have been using it for several months and love it.  "
20067261, On Anti-Aging Sheet Mask Set ,Jessica M.,Combination,18-24, I loved that it came as a set and you have options! So you can try different brands and something new for tackling your anti-aging routine. 
20067261, On Anti-Aging Sheet Mask Set ,Elizabeth,Combination,25-35," Nothing new from what is already on the site. Only came with one $6 mask, so it would be cheaper to buy separately. Still good masks though. "
20067261, On Anti-Aging Sheet Mask Set ,Vivian P.,Combination,18-24, got this set for my mom but it came with sheet mask we already had 
20067261, On Anti-Aging Sheet Mask Set ,Aurora G.,Combination,45-55, Worth the purchase. Soko glam does a great job curating the masks. 
20067261, On Anti-Aging Sheet Mask Set ,K,Sensitive,25-35," I had high expectation on this. However, the masks I received do not fee anti-aging for me...three of the 5 masks says ""brighting"" on the packaging... "
49904349, On Keratin Power Glue ,Bree,Dry,25-35, I like the smell of this product but it's not quite as hydrating as I'd like it to be. I'll keep trying it out and see if maybe I'm just not using enough. 
49904349, On Keratin Power Glue ,Anna W.,Sensitive,25-35," I love this product! I rarely spend money on products for my hair, but my current hairstyle requires lots of heat/styling and I was looking for a product that would provide some protection and add some shine without making my hair too slippery to style. The smell, texture and results of this product do not disappoint. My hair is noticeably shinier and feels healthier. I went on a trip for a week without it and immediately noticed a difference--my hair looked more dull, felt coarser, and smelled like I had used heat on it without it. My natural hair is thick, straight, and fairly coarse, in case that's helpful. "
49904349, On Keratin Power Glue ,Karen,Combination,18-24, Smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft. And it doesn't weigh my hair down at all! 
49904349, On Keratin Power Glue ,Angiemckee0@gmail.com,Oily,25-35, I tried the whole bottle. It leaves a heavy or ticker hair feeling. But I does make it straight 
49904349, On Keratin Power Glue ,Cathy S.,>55,>55, Haven't tried it yet 
188810653, On Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Circle Eye Cream ,Anona,Oily,Oily, This product did not do much. Have used it for 4 months and did not observe any changes. The only good thing about it is that it lacks fragrance. 
188810653, On Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Circle Eye Cream ,Stephanie B.,Combination,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
188810653, On Green Tangerine Vita C Dark Circle Eye Cream ,Regina I.,Dry,25-35, This Eye Gel has a Great consistency it glides on beautifully and hydrates wonderfully! I can't speak to the dark under eye changes - as I have just started using it - but hoping this will help! 
14684713, On Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream ,Mary S.,55-64, No, I began using your line for the clean ingredients.. and then I ordered this product.. and lo and behold this cream contains phenoxyethanol…an endocrine disrupter.. so nope it is bad. 
14684713, On Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream ,Michelle, No,Other, I’ve started using this with the snail essence and my skin has brightened up 
14684713, On Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream ,Davi,Fine Lines/Wrinkles,35-44," I’ve been using this for as long as I can remember and I’ve never, ever stopped. Nothing gives me the hydration and glow that this does. It’s also so lightweight, and is honestly perfect year round. I have extremely sensitive, oily, and acne prone and this has probably been the reason that my skin is so clear now. "
14684713, On Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream ,Ahed O.,25-34, No, Love it 
14684713, On Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream ,nidhi h., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, I dont see any result nor it gives me glass skin. Super drying formula 
18970403, On Moistfull Collagen Facial Toner ,Rachel,Dry,45-55, I read reviews and thought this would be ok on my sensitive skin. It wasn’t. It burned pretty bad. Even without the burning I don”t think I like this product. I bought it because it was supposed to be very moisturizing - It had the opposite effect on me. After just one use it made my skin feel extremely dry. I am just not happy with this product. 
18970403, On Moistfull Collagen Facial Toner ,Jo,Sensitive,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
18970403, On Moistfull Collagen Facial Toner ,Madison,Combination,25-35, Didn't give me a good reaction on my face so I'm sad about the loss but it's not all bad news. I'm instead using it for my legs and arms and I love it!! 
69147320, On French Propolis 82% Resistem Ampoule ,Ilona,Sensitive,45-55," It does work great for acne and my aging, sensitive skin. Propolis also helped on my very irritated skin under the nose after infection. I'm going to repurchase it for sure. "
69147320, On French Propolis 82% Resistem Ampoule ,Leidy R.,Normal,35-44, It makes my skin look super hydrated and has no smell whatsoever! A little goes a long way!!! 
69147320, On French Propolis 82% Resistem Ampoule ,Rachel,Dry,25-35, Loved this product! Great price for awesome quality 
69147320, On French Propolis 82% Resistem Ampoule ,Cecilia D.,Dry,18-24, Haven't given much time to see a difference but it's feels nice doesn't hurt my skin and I feel Hydrated from it 
69147320, On French Propolis 82% Resistem Ampoule ,M D.,Normal,18-24, Propolis is the best ingredient to use in the winter. This formulation is great and a steal at this price. Thicker ampoules have my heart 
221747855, On Yuzu Vitamin C Bright Eye Cream ,Angela G.,Combination,25-35," just starting to incorporate into my routine and really enjoying so far. light, pleasant scent "
221747855, On Yuzu Vitamin C Bright Eye Cream ,MichS,25-35,25-35, I really enjoyed this product and would definitely buy it again ! I wish they made bigger versions of it because its so nice and hydrating. You do not need too much product either ! 
221747855, On Yuzu Vitamin C Bright Eye Cream ,Elizabeth H.,Dry,35-44," I love this eye cream, its hydrating, goes in smoothly and a little goes a long way. "
221747855, On Yuzu Vitamin C Bright Eye Cream ,Hermine,Oily,55+," I purchased this after receiving samples. I wanted to wait a bit before writing a review. I have found a eye cream I will be sticking with! I have tried several eye creams just because you should use a eye cream and never got the results that I do with thus one! It feels good going on, I have definitely noticed a big difference in the lines AND discoloration under my eyes not to mention it soaks in almost immediately . Now I finally see 1st hand what a great eye cream can do! PERFECT for me and I feel confident others will feel the same way!!! "
221747855, On Yuzu Vitamin C Bright Eye Cream ,Stacy B.,Combination,35-44, I really enjoy this eye cream. Does a good job maintaining moisture under and around my eyes. 
10680791, On Quick Starter Skincare Set ,Shirley J.,Combination,35-44, I like the kit overall but not a huge fan of the moisturizer's greasy after-feel. 
10680791, On Quick Starter Skincare Set ,Lyudmyla L.,Normal,25-35, I liked everything I used in the set and it was a great way to explore different brands and products. I usually don't like sets because products can be a hit or miss but I used everything without any irritation. I have normal skin so can't really expect any improvement. These products have helped maintain my skin nicely. 
10680791, On Quick Starter Skincare Set ,Kassandra,Dry,<18," This is a great product when you are trying to start somewhere, out of all of the products the moisturizer is my favorite. It was lightweight despite its appearance (which I was very wary of at first) and feels so refreshing and gives that dewy look as well as prime moisturization. I've struggled with finding a lightweight good moisturizer but this is a life-changer. I have dry skin mostly and this absolutely saved my face. I like how nothing is very overly scented, I don't like heavily scented skincare products so this was perfect for me! The serum really did help my skin with redness and irritation, especially on my cheeks I notice it clearing up after using a multitude of products that don't work. If you are looking for hydration and dewy skin this is for you! "
10680791, On Quick Starter Skincare Set ,Lin C.,Sensitive,25-35, Falling in love with my skin a little more everyday ❣️ 
10680791, On Quick Starter Skincare Set ,Maria F.,Combination,25-35, I left a review on each products! This set is great for simple steps. All items really made a difference on my skin. It helped with my breakouts and oils. I have combo skin and this set was perfect! The cleanser and toner were perfect and my favorite out of the bunch! 
180461895, On Prime Time Refining Toning Essence ,Cristina M.,Combination,45-55," I always compare cleansing toners to my gold standard, Son & Park Beauty Water. This toner seems to have similar ingredients, but the power is not the same. It smells nice and does a good job of cleansing, but I need to use more than one cotton pad to get everything off. For moisturizing, it does make your skin soft without being sticky. "
180461895, On Prime Time Refining Toning Essence ,Naomi B.,Combination,18-24,We're so sorry to hear that this toner didn't work out for you. Please reach out to us at 
180461895, On Prime Time Refining Toning Essence ,Erin,Normal,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted:) 
34913369, On Wonder Rice Smoothing Toner ,Mary M.,Oily,45-55," I absolutely love this toner! It is so effective at cutting down the excess sebum while being mild on my skin. There's no burning or redness at application, just smooth, silky coolness, and it smells so good! The bottle is large, so it will also last a long time. This is my favorite toner ever. "
34913369, On Wonder Rice Smoothing Toner ,Bailey,Combination,18-24," Definitely added something to my routine, but not a huge impact. Overall, good product. "
34913369, On Wonder Rice Smoothing Toner ,Julie M.,Oily,55+," My skin is glowing!! I have struggled for years trying to find products for my oily skin and nothing worked and was too expensive. My skin is rehydrated, smooth and glowing! "
34913369, On Wonder Rice Smoothing Toner ,Baujci X.,Combination,25-35, I love love this toner. It’s smells great and there is no sticky residue after use! Also has improve the appearance of discoloration and has lighten my freckles 🤗 
34913369, On Wonder Rice Smoothing Toner ,Kezi,Combination,<18," The product is very refreshing to use, but it’s definitely not as moisturizing as I was expecting. I do think that this product would be great for layering or oily skin, though. But for me, I just didn’t get any results after adding this to my routine. "
236163701, On Mugwort Cream ,nancy h.,Normal,35-44," nice thick-ish consistency, but feels light once it's on my face.. ""For better results, use it with every other mugwort products"" xD "
236163701, On Mugwort Cream ,Djobi,Normal,25-35,"Also, i think it helps with meshing a couple of products together without the dreaded ~pilling~ "
236163701, On Mugwort Cream ,Emma P.,Dry,18-24, I keep coming back to this cream - great texture and soothing. 
236163701, On Mugwort Cream ,Kelsey,Normal,35-44, I love this...it's super hydrating and makes my face feel smooth and firm. I'm taking a star off because I wish there was more product. 
236163701, On Mugwort Cream ,Elena,Sensitive,45-55," This is my all time favorite moisturizer. I’m pretty sure this is my 4th bottle and I haven’t found anything else that compares, especially at this price point. "
80494667, On Vita Duo Cream Joan Day Joan Night ,Caroline,Oily,35-44, Can’t say enough good things about this day and night moisturizer. I got it while pregnant as a nontoxic way to keep my skin healthy and it was incredible. 
80494667, On Vita Duo Cream Joan Day Joan Night ,Hailey,Sensitive,18-24," I've been a diehard Cetaphil user for years but I think this product is even better, really leaving my skin feeling light, tight, and glowing. Very convenient to have the day and night in the same bottle but thoughtfully separated so nothing spills over. I've used it for a few days and I can already feel a real difference in my skin clarity. "
80494667, On Vita Duo Cream Joan Day Joan Night ,Rebecca N.,Combination,45-55, Love the way this makes my skin feel hydrated and smooth. The night cream tingles a little making me feel like it’s working to heal small blemishes. 
80494667, On Vita Duo Cream Joan Day Joan Night ,Bree,Combination,35-44," I bought this a year ago and still have plenty left! You don’t need much. The day cream is nice and light and not grease once absorbed. The night gel is cool and calming, not greasy at all. Both leave my skin feeling soft and refreshed. "
80494667, On Vita Duo Cream Joan Day Joan Night ,Afrida,Sensitive,18-24, No words for this. On my 3rd one and absolutely in love with how it makes my skin feel! 
236163342, On Rice Cream ,Sammy,Combination,No," I’ve been using this for several weeks and I’m loving it. I have sensitive, dry combo skin. The product is thick and rich but I can wear it morning and night. Also easy on my skin. "
236163342, On Rice Cream ,elizabeth h.,No,18-24," After starting to feel really dry during the winter months, I purchased this cream and may never go back. I love the thick, creamy texture and moisture that it gives my skin that lasts all day or night. "
236163342, On Rice Cream ,khushdeep k.,25-35,Combination, Good 
236163342, On Rice Cream ,Chloe,Dry,No," This moisturizer is fantastic! I use this during my morning routine as it’s light, has a cooling feeling when first applied, easily spreads, and absorbs quickly. I will for sure repurchase this product and also recommend the ginseng eye cream. The I’m From brand is quickly becoming a favorite of mine! "
236163342, On Rice Cream ,Bonnie G.,No,18-24," This is my second rice product from this brand (I also have the rice toner), and I'm a big fan of both. I use this as my last step in my evening routine, and it feels luxurious on my skin, leaving it very soft. "
253340101, On Glow Deep Serum: Rice + Alpha-Arbutin ,Izzy,Dry,18-24, I've been using this for the past nine months and see a huge difference in my scarring. It feels amazing on my skin and has noticeable helped even out my skin tone and scarring. I have nearly no scarring now. Would definetely reccommend for anyone with acne scars. 
253340101, On Glow Deep Serum: Rice + Alpha-Arbutin ,Zack,Combination,25-35, I’m on my third bottle of this and it has become a mainstay of my skincare. The rice bran water is a lovely addition and leaves my skin happy and glowing! 
253340101, On Glow Deep Serum: Rice + Alpha-Arbutin ,Erin,Combination,25-35, i love using this serum at NIGHT (alpha arbutin is more stable in the dark). skin is glowy and hydrated and my skin looks brighter. ANOTHER HOLY GRAIL THATS SOLD OUT IM GOING TO CRY 
253340101, On Glow Deep Serum: Rice + Alpha-Arbutin ,Sai,Dry,25-35," At first, I liked the product because it absorbed into my skin well but after a couple of weeks use I started noticing tiny bumps on my face and clogged pores. I used this right after my cleanser and followed with a moisturizer. Removed this from my routine and the bumps disappeared. Added it back in and the bumps were also back. It's likely that the arbutin didn't work well with my skin sadly "
136923234, On I'm Safe For Sensitive Skin ,Allie,Sensitive,25-35," I hope they never discontinue this product. It's the ONLY sunscreen that doesn't give me some kind of reaction (red face, break outs, dry tight feeling, too greasy etc). This goes on like NOTHING, it's an invisible feeling. I recommend it to everyone. I never leave reviews, but I want to keep this product around forever!!! "
136923234, On I'm Safe For Sensitive Skin ,Victoria F.,Normal,18-24," I'm a dark-skinned Black woman and I thought this sunscreen would be a safe bet (and not leave a white cast.) Unfortunately, this was a trojan horse scenario. It looks normal to the naked eye but I look casket ready every time my camera turns on. "
136923234, On I'm Safe For Sensitive Skin ,Valeria,Dry,35-44, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
136923234, On I'm Safe For Sensitive Skin ,KIARA R.,Dry,18-24," This is my favorite sunscreen. It gives me a dewey glow and keeps my skin feeling soothed. I'm pretty senstive to sunscreen - it can cause inflammation - redness, itchiness, and hyperpigmentation - but I've NEVER had an issue with this product. My skin drinks it in like water :) It's not sticky, either. Feels great on my finger and on my face afterwards. Definitely an instant fav! "
89653291, On Pore Cleansing Balm [PHA] ,Autumn J.,Oily,25-35," I truly enjoy this as a makeup remover, but the oily feel left on my skin has me cleanse with a regular cleanser after. I feel like my pores are lighter as a result! "
89653291, On Pore Cleansing Balm [PHA] ,M P.,Oily,35-44," First time using a cleansing balm. Had to watch some videos on how to use it properly. Prior to using this, I used to use the Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads which I loved. After using this cleansing balm, I noticed my skin would become oily later on in the day, I do have oily skin but I hadn't noticed that when I used the Coconut Oil Cleansing Pads. The only change I've made to my routine is this particular oil cleanser so I'm not really sure if it works for my skin type. As a product, it's good and it does what it's supposed to, I just don't think it worked for me. "
89653291, On Pore Cleansing Balm [PHA] ,Amanda M.,Combination,35-44, I’ve never used a cleansing balm before but I’m never going back. It’s so nice and doesn’t dry out my skin 
89653291, On Pore Cleansing Balm [PHA] ,S,Combination,18-24, without a second cleanser my face doesn't feel clean enough 
18257436, On M BB Boomer Primer ,Laurie D.,Combination,35-44, If a Dewy look to your skin is what you want - then you NEED this primer! 
18257436, On M BB Boomer Primer ,Ash,Sensitive,25-35," I've been using this for 8 years now. Works under any brand or as a stand alone. Doesn't matter if its bb, just concealer, cushion compact, or full face foundation. Fantastic product. Great price point and lasts absolute ages before you need a new one. "
18257436, On M BB Boomer Primer ,Jennifer L.,Dry,35-44,"Doesn't clump up, or crease (as long as you aren't over applying, A little goes a long way) breathes well (which living in central FL is a must), doesn't break me out and zero reactions.  "
18257436, On M BB Boomer Primer ,lea,Combination,18-24,I also love the missha BB. I'm extremely fair (I go between custard and breeze in clinique shades) and the BB boomer and BB pair extremely well together while having a shade that actually suits my skin tone.  
18257436, On M BB Boomer Primer ,Sandy F.,Sensitive,45-55,They don't slop off but if you are masking you need to still apply a setting spray. 
80494592, On Dynasty Cream ,caitlin,Combination,18-24, feels so great on my skin! 
80494592, On Dynasty Cream ,Carrie,Combination,25-35," I’m not sure what exactly in this caused my skin to break out, but it broke me out so bad! Immediately after putting it on my skin burned so bad then had the worst break outs I’ve had in so long. Wanted to love it but it’s a no go for sensitive skin. :: "
80494592, On Dynasty Cream ,Arianna,Combination,25-35,We're so sorry to hear that this cream didn't work out for you. Please reach out to us at 
88721114, On Clean It Zero Foam Cleanser ,Kristina,Combination,35-44," I felt like it was a little drying, so be careful for that. Easy, light scent and good if you like a light foaming cleanser. "
88721114, On Clean It Zero Foam Cleanser ,Makayla,Dry,18-24," To preface I do have dry skin. I loved this cleanser! However, on dryer days or when I used only this cleanser I did experience tightness. On oilier/combo skin types this is probably the ideal cleanser. For dryer skin or sensitive it may be too drying if you’re not using enough hydrating products. "
88721114, On Clean It Zero Foam Cleanser ,Nichole B.,Oily,<18,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
170123013, On Laser Sunscreen 100 SPF 50+/PA+++ ,JESSICA V.,Normal,35-44," I will keep using the product, however it does not live up to my current SPF. Feels a little too blah on my skin, was hoping for slightly more hydration "
170123013, On Laser Sunscreen 100 SPF 50+/PA+++ ,TEA N.,Dry,35-44,We are so sorry to hear this product did not work out for you. Please reach out to us via e-mail with your order number and we'll be happy to get you all sorted! 
170123013, On Laser Sunscreen 100 SPF 50+/PA+++ ,Ree,Combination,18-24, Thick and moist but absorbs into my skin in 20 minutes. Ample moisture so I like this sunscreen for the cold winter days but switch to something lighter for the hot balmy days. 
225888724, On Paraffin Foot Mask EX ,Summer,Combination,25-35, This product was extremely hydrating! 
225888724, On Paraffin Foot Mask EX ,Ilene M.,Combination,55+, It is a wonderful product messy but your feet become so soft 
225888724, On Paraffin Foot Mask EX ,Jp,Combination,18-24, These are really nice to use after a long day and fresh out the shower to de-stress and relax my feet. 
225888724, On Paraffin Foot Mask EX ,Olivia N.,Dry,25-35, Great feet masks. My feet always feel soft and moisturized after use. 
236163677, On Mugwort Essence ,Alina V.,Dry,No," I always heard great things about this and just never got around to purchasing it since I always have so many toners/essences. But I’m so glad I bought this and this is definitely something that will stay in my cabinet. It has some viscosity that it is hydrating. But since I have very dry skin I need to do several layers. This helps balance my skin and keep my pores clear. Since we’re still in the colder months it’s not quite hydrating enough to follow up with sunscreen, but I know once it gets warmer and the viscosity it has it should be. Very excited about this product "
236163677, On Mugwort Essence ,Shawn P.,No,35-44," I purchased the mugwort essence, snail mugwort mucin energy essence, and mugwort cream. I cleansed my face before using all of these products in the order i consecutively listed them as, but I did use toner before applying them. I woke up this morning and my redness and imflamation was reduced by 75% . I’m from products just got a life long customer. My mugwort mask was broken, but their customer service is already sending me a new jar after I emailed them. "
236163677, On Mugwort Essence ,Cara,>55,Sensitive, although this product did not eradicate the redness I developed during the winter in my cheeks it does soothe my skin. I use this product after toning with my indie lee toner and follow it with an additional essence the snail mucin. Maybe I am not using it with the right products to eradicate the redness? Or perhaps I have not used it for long enough. Regardless I am enjoying how this product feels on my skin and it is certainly non-irritating. A Soko glam representative advised me to purchase this and I think they made a strong recommendation. 
236163677, On Mugwort Essence ,Felicia,Normal,No, My skin always seems to relax and chill out after using this. Will buy again! 
236163677, On Mugwort Essence ,Lilia B.,No,45-55," This completely changed my skin! I have super sensitive, reactive skin but this product soothed it. I was able to notice a change almost immediately and within a few days the redness and irritation was completely gone. My skin is able to really absorb and retain moisture now. I love it! "
289133854, On Fixing Tint ,Elizabeth M.,Combination,25-35," I bought two colors, Vintage Red and Midnight Mauve, and I use them everyday. Midnight Mauve is a good pink color, while Vintage Red is pretty orange, like a summer red. They are pretty drying, but they’re perfect under gloss because once they dry down they really don’t budge at all.  "
289133854, On Fixing Tint ,Jenn,Combination,25-35,"I am white (Missha No. 21), with warm undertones if that helps anyone make a call on the colors. "
289133854, On Fixing Tint ,Brittany,35-44,35-44," I have almost the whole set of these by now I like them so much, I will say, I do find myself re-applying throughout the day, so if you are looking for something that lasts you all day this isn't it. For me, that doesn't bother me at all. I really like the colors and the way it is so light on my lips. Sometimes I will pair it with a light gloss for a little shine. "
289133854, On Fixing Tint ,Kev,Combination,25-35," I cant tell by the names what color it corresponds to because the names of them aren't listed under the tints, super misleading. I took a chance and bought two and don't like them at all. don't think it stays on as well as i thought it would. pretty disappointed, would not buy again. "
170001394, On MadeCera Cream Double Essence Toner ,Laurie D.,Combination,35-44, This Combo Toner leaves my skin Feeling Balanced and Hydrated! and GLOWING! 
170001394, On MadeCera Cream Double Essence Toner ,Vanessa L.,Sensitive,45-55," Nice scent, gave me smooth skin, amd removed blackheads. Definitely going to buy again "
170001394, On MadeCera Cream Double Essence Toner ,Val,Combination,18-24, I've been using this for about a year. It is very hydrating and feels good when applied. I have mature skin and feel this is a great choice for someone who needs the extra skin hydration 
170001394, On MadeCera Cream Double Essence Toner ,Caryn A.,Combination,45-55, This is a great moisturizing toner. Love the way it smells and feels 
24638937, On 5-Step Anti-Aging Set ,Darcy,Normal,25-35," I have done 2 sets, this one and the starter set. This set has more steps but feels really great after. Both my face and my hands feel amazing after using this set.  "
24638937, On 5-Step Anti-Aging Set ,Alth,Sensitive,45-55,I only give this a 4 as the serum says to use sunscreen SPF 30+ but the kit does not come with it. I would recommend doing this kit with an SPF attached as most over-the-counter sunscreen is pretty terrible and the Thank You Farmer sunscreen is amazing! 
24638937, On 5-Step Anti-Aging Set ,Mel,Combination,25-35, I didn't know where to start so I bought this kit and I am glad I did. I plan to buy it again. 
24638937, On 5-Step Anti-Aging Set ,Edyta S.,Normal,35-44, The coconut pads are one of the best makeup removing options. Smooth and hydrating plus nice to have a pre soaked cotton pad. Haven’t used most of the other products yet but love that one 
80494512, On Amino Moisture Mask ,Amarissa,Dry,18-24," I have extremely dry skin, and have to slowly introduce products incase it causes a dry spell or irritation. I have been using this mask specifically for 6 years and every time my skin looks dewy, glowy, and plump after use (even if I use it the night before!). If you have dry skin or just need a good mask that'll give you a boost--this product will not disappoint. "
80494512, On Amino Moisture Mask ,Joan R.,Dry,55+, This mask is very reasonable. It fits the face well and plumps the skin. 
80494512, On Amino Moisture Mask ,Vittbentz,Normal,18-24, I have a normal skin type but it is severely dehydrated...this mask did wonders for my skin! it moisturized it to the max and I can honestly say that my skin was amazing and looked so healthy for days! 
80494512, On Amino Moisture Mask ,nikki m.,Sensitive,18-24, one of my favorites 
80494512, On Amino Moisture Mask ,Stephanie B.,Dry,35-44," This amino moisturizer mask left me dewy, soft & very moisturized. My makeup foundation never looked better! "
49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,Tess R.,Oily,25-35," Great lightweight moisturizer. Great calming effect, but wanted to try something a little more heavier. "
49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,Deanna,Combination,25-35, Very light cream that leaves your skin feeling clean and hydrated. I use primarily during the day especially if I am outdoors or working out. 
49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,Mikaila H.,Normal,>55, Soooo soft it is absurd. Like one of the softer products I’ve ever put on my skin. Feels heavenly and hydrates well. 
49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,Haleigh K.,Dry,18-24, just the right night cream for summer! 
40553437, On Madecassoside Cream 2X ,Elven Y.,Oily,25-35," So initial contact, my face loved it but I would wake up with small pimples. I’m not sure if it’s due to the fragrance. It is very moisturizing. I’ve been using it as a body lotion since my face can’t handle it. "
40553437, On Madecassoside Cream 2X ,M D.,Sensitive,35-44, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
40553437, On Madecassoside Cream 2X ,Sarah S.,Normal,18-24," While my dry skin needs something more rich during fall/winter months, this is my go to for the warmer months. Doesn't irritate my acne prone skin and use specifically to manage breakouts. Texture is a bit watery but aborbs quickly. Little goes a long way with this, doesn't pill, and sunscreen/makeup applies well over it. Have been using for years and so glad it's easier to find/buy now. "
40553437, On Madecassoside Cream 2X ,Maddy,Combination,35-44," I don’t use many products with silicones, I used the entirety of this product and my skin was super soft and I didn’t break out once. This is a great product to use in the winter. "
93972087, On A-Clear Soothing Pink Eraser ,Chevonne S.,Combination,35-44," I like this product. I find that my pimple clears up faster when using this product. Only thing is when I apply it to my face and I forget it's there, it sucks being in public fully unaware of pink dots on your face. Lol. One feedback though, the ratio of the pink stuff compared to the clear liquid should be adjusted in my opinion. I always run out of the clear liquid first before the pink stuff and have to toss the whole bottle away since it is too dry to use the pink stuff without the clear liquid. "
93972087, On A-Clear Soothing Pink Eraser ,Gosia,Oily,<18, I purchased this item for my teenage daughters and they absolutely love it! 
93972087, On A-Clear Soothing Pink Eraser ,Candace L.,Oily,35-44," It helped shrink a couple pimples overnight, but others were unfazed and nothing dried up completely. I have oily slightly sensitive skin so at least it's not causing any problems, but it's not giving miraculous results either. I also have some deep pores usually around my acne and the pink goop gets stuck in there when I'm trying to remove it. "
93972087, On A-Clear Soothing Pink Eraser ,Jaina,Combination,18-24, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
40533577, On Glycolic Acid Cream ,Anja,Dry,25-35, I alternate days with differin gel and this glycolic acid treatment. Its much less irritating than other chemical exfoliant treatments I've tried. I use this cream at night and the day after I often notice that my breakouts have been reduced and my skin is smoother. I've had this cream for over 6 months and I'm only half way through the bottle. I don't think its an effective moisturizer on its on and I always follow up with something else. The price is great for the quality of this product and I will be repurchasing. 
40533577, On Glycolic Acid Cream ,Andrea,Dry,35-44, Really good product but felt a bit harsh for my skin. my skin is dry but quite sensitive 
40533577, On Glycolic Acid Cream ,Gillian O.,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
208520852, On pH Balancing Bubble Free Cleansing Gel ,Krista C.,Combination,25-35, I had high hopes for this because I love the toner but it literally disappears on your face. It doesn’t matter how much you use it doesn’t feel like there is anything there.. it’s weird 
208520852, On pH Balancing Bubble Free Cleansing Gel ,Naomi G.,Combination,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
208520852, On pH Balancing Bubble Free Cleansing Gel ,Angie D.,Combination,18-24, It does a great job and my skin feels great after washing but I personally just felt a little frustrated using it. This was my first time using a bubble free cleanser and I just couldn’t get use to it! Overall it works great but I’m ready to try something new. 
208520852, On pH Balancing Bubble Free Cleansing Gel ,Elena,Normal,25-35," I love using this cleanser on the days i do not use the Klog Cleanser and i love how i still feel my skin clean, smooth, and Is great for sensitive skin. I love this cleanser and will definitely keep using, "
204503654, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Pore Clarifying ,Jasmine C.,Combination,25-35, This is the only cleansing balm I buy now. I absolutely love the feel of it and it really does clear out pores. 
204503654, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Pore Clarifying ,Alexandra F.,Oily,18-24," I was recommended this product during a consultation after I said I wanted to start double cleansing with an oil based cleanser and then a water based cleanser, but to be honest, and I might be the problem here, but I honestly don’t feel cleaner at all when I use this. It’s hard to spread on my skin. I’ve tried rubbing it straight on, wetting my hands, wetting my face, putting it on and then wetting my face with the product on, nothing is really working. I think when this runs out I’m going to have to try a different product. "
204503654, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Pore Clarifying ,Rachel,Oily,35-44, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
204503654, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Pore Clarifying ,Angela O.,Dry,25-35, this stuff is great for very gentle exfoliating and for oily skin types. removes my makeup better than a liquid oil cleanser. I use this first followed by a liquid oil cleanser followed by a foaming cleanser and I love it. 
91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,Yvonne C.,Combination,25-35, i love it so much I keep repurchasing! 
91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,Solongo J.,Oily,25-35," After i watched freezia youtube channel i bought it right away because her skin condition was very similar ( dehydrated, dry and after cleansing extreme dry etc)  "
91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,krys,Combination,18-24,i have been using this for two weeks and already my skin is very hydrated and absorbing other products i put after the lotion very good. No sticky feeling and absorb very quickly in 1 min.  
91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,Keira M.,Dry,55+,Using both morning and evening skincare.  
188811743, On Safe Sun Fluid AGE 0880 SPF50+ PA++++ ,Ca,Combination,25-35, Great for the price. You get more than some other sunscreens. I do have to make sure to rub it in well so it doesn't leave a white cast though. Has a powdery smell which I like. 
188811743, On Safe Sun Fluid AGE 0880 SPF50+ PA++++ ,Jeanie,Combination,18-24," I used these after being sent a free bottle by SOKOGLAM and started using them in this summer. Couldn't recommend it more! I love the bottle and how it's dispensed. There was no white cast for me and I didn't burn at all. It seemed pretty great in the water too! If I had to have a complaint, it would be whenever I came back from the gym I would have a bit of white streaks from sweat, but after rubbing it away, it's not noticeable. "
188811743, On Safe Sun Fluid AGE 0880 SPF50+ PA++++ ,Mun,Dry,25-35," Gives me a dewy look, and the white cast does blend in with my light medium skin tone. "
188811743, On Safe Sun Fluid AGE 0880 SPF50+ PA++++ ,SG,Normal,25-35," Once I rubbed this in thoroughly, the white cast wasn't too bad on my medium-brown skin. The smell reminds me of old lady perfume and it is extremely strong. This alone wouldn't deter me from using it, but my skin is starting to get bumpy and break out after just two days of use :( Sad, because I wanted to love it. "
187003278, On AC Clear Magic Cica Cream ,samantha,Sensitive,18-24," I have always struggled with finding the right moisturizer for my skin. I have sensitive skin and any changes cause pain and breakouts but this moisturizer has saved me from that pain. After using it for the last year, my skin has cleared up and isn't as sensitive when I try new products. "
187003278, On AC Clear Magic Cica Cream ,Krystyna,Sensitive,25-35," I can't say this is a miracle product, but it's pretty awesome. It works great as a moisturizer for the price point, way better than other moisturizers I tried that were much more expensive. The most important thing is that my skin hasn't reacted to it, and although it hasn't stopped my breakouts entirely (they're due to food sensitivities and hormones), it does a really good job of soothing the inflammation. For dry skin, this wouldn't be a great fit, but if you're oily / combo and acne-prone, definitely try this. If they ever discontinue this product, I'll be super bummed. "
187003278, On AC Clear Magic Cica Cream ,Elizabeth W.,Combination,25-35," I am acne prone, this cica cream really has really helped. Idk how I ever survived without it! "
187003278, On AC Clear Magic Cica Cream ,Rose K.,Combination,25-35," OK! I had this product saved to give it away because I thought would not work for my skin type, but I was wrong. I live in a humid tropical country where our only season is summer so I tend to get acne mainly on my cheeks and chin, this leads to blackheads and blemishes on my face and I have been using this every night for two weeks already and have noticed that my skin is softer and the spots on my face have been disappearing, also the areas where I tend to have more acne have diminished. This cream is really effective! You just have to be patient with it. "
161994526, On Pore Cleansing Oil [AHA] ,Karen R.,Combination,55+," Love how it makes my skin feel, I can feel it going to work and cleaning me up! "
161994526, On Pore Cleansing Oil [AHA] ,Jasmine P.,Combination,25-35, I really enjoy this product. No stripping and my skin still feels moisturized after washing. 
161994526, On Pore Cleansing Oil [AHA] ,Pachia,Combination,25-35," Aside from Banila Co oil cleanser, this is my go-to oil based cleanser. Leaves my skin refreshed and ready for my water based cleanser! "
161994526, On Pore Cleansing Oil [AHA] ,Misty,Combination,18-24, I this oil cleanser lasts a while and I’m about buy my second bottle. It leaves my skin feeling so clean without drying it out at all. It’s also great at removing any makeup left. I would most definitely recommend it to anyone with combination skin 
161994526, On Pore Cleansing Oil [AHA] ,Taylor C.,Sensitive,25-35," Love this cleanser. It's really gentle for my dry, sensitive skin. "
144338863, On AC Collection Acne Patch ,Amina,Combination,25-35," Out of all the pimple patches I have tried these are definitely best to use! They’re invisible, stick very well, are very flexible, and their shape makes it easy to cover any breakout! I highly recommend trying these! "
144338863, On AC Collection Acne Patch ,Kim,Oily,18-24," Super convenient. Wish there were more bigger sizes and fewer smaller ones, which can be a hassle to apply. "
144338863, On AC Collection Acne Patch ,Rachel,Normal,25-35," This product is crazy. I bought it specifically because it says it works on cystic acne, and guess what? It DOES. It usually takes about a day or a day and a half of wearing one before a white head appears on my cystic acne but I’ve had a patch work in as little as half a day. Love these so much I am already on my second pack. Truly a miracle worker!! "
144338863, On AC Collection Acne Patch ,Kirstin L.,Sensitive,25-35," I've tried a few American pimple patches like truly and starface because I like the cute designs, and some jumbo patches from Amazon, but none of them pulled as much out of the problem spot as these little guys here! Definitely the most effective I've tried, and they stay put "
144338863, On AC Collection Acne Patch ,Makaela,Sensitive,25-35, I like the unique size and shape of these patches. Great for clustered breakouts. 
10231988, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Oily Skin Type) ,Danee,Oily,25-35, I love this skin care line. This is the second line I’ve bought from Soko Glam and I can honestly say that I am extremely pleased with the results. That said there are some cons to this line of products—but not so bad that I wouldn’t buy again. 
10231988, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Oily Skin Type) ,Stephanie L.,Combination,35-44,Cons: 
10231988, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Oily Skin Type) ,Andrea M.,Oily,25-35,"—the smell of the products is somewhat chemically, there’s maybe one or two products that I enjoy the smell of and the rest are just “meh” "
10231988, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Oily Skin Type) ,Melissa J.,Oily,25-35,"—I hate the texture of the cica cream, it’s extremely thick and leaves a weird residue on my face. "
154020818, On Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream ,Paula,Sensitive,18-24," I apply this right before I sleep and I never wake up with dry hands, it also has a slight botanical scent which is pleasant. "
154020818, On Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream ,Caitlin E.,Combination,18-24, Very moisturizing and light weight. Drys pretty fast without any sticky feeling. Has a light citrus/herb scent. 
154020818, On Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream ,lavendervvoo,Dry,25-35," This product needs to be sold at every department store all over the world. It's buttery and soft without being icky. The product is also the right size, and I can tell the brand thought of all the details especially because the tip where the product comes out has rounded edges and helps the product apply really nicely. The cream itself is very healing as ceramides are, and the formula is just perfect. "
154020818, On Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream ,Micaela,Sensitive,25-35," I have sensitive skin and eczema, this is a wonderful hand cream. It is not watery, absorb quickly, doesn't leave much residue, and really repairs skin dried from hand sanitizer use and lots of washing. There is a very mild fragrance. I've purchased it twice now! It's perfect. "
154020818, On Super Ceramide 100™ Intense Protection Hand Cream ,Lisa K.,Dry,25-35, Scent doesn't bother me its very light. 
40553421, On Hydrate Hair Butter ,Mary,Combination,Combination," I have fine, straight, colored treated, chin length hair. I thought I would try this as a nourishing hair treatment. I shampooed my hair & left it in for 15 min, then rinsed & styled using my regular 2 products. My hair looks incredible! It has more body & texture, which is a total surprise, while being shiny & bouncy, which I definitely was not expecting. Excellent product& I highly recommend it. My only complaint would be the scent is way too strong for my taste, but still a top notch hair treatment. "
40553421, On Hydrate Hair Butter ,Ren,Combination,25-35, I found it to be a nice daily leave-in. My hair feels moisturized without being greasy. 
40553421, On Hydrate Hair Butter ,Stephanie,Normal,25-35," I've used up the whole bottle and left it in longer than 15 minutes every time I've used it. Unfortunately, I've just had better luck with just my weekly jojoba hair oiling routine. "
7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,iman B.,Normal,25-35, Very moisturizing!! 
7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,Sim,Dry,18-24," I personally really like this. It's not like most lotions, it's not a cream-like texture. Nevertheless, it's good! "
7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,Sara M.,Dry,18-24, I really wanted to like this because I thought the ingredients would work well on my skin and it was fairly cheap but I ended up breaking out and having lots of little bumps all over my skin. I have normal-dry skin and it doesn't take a lot for my skin to break out but something about this moisturizer didn't work well for my skin. I am now struggling with breakouts along my forehead and hairline area with little bumps all over my skin (maybe like clogged pores or something like that? just created more texture that I didn't have before). I followed what people said and only used 1 pump every time I used it but still didn't work. 
7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,Maria,Normal,18-24,"I used to use it as my moisturizer for day and night but wanted to experiment on what was causing my breakout so I decided to just use it during the day-- see if using it less would help. When I started doing that, I realized that the breakout started calming down but, obviously, still there since I used it in the morning. I'm now looking for a different moisturizer for the winter time but if you decide to get it just be careful and to test it on your skin slowly! "
80494426, On AC Clear Treatment Mask ,Meghan,Dry,25-35, This mask kinda burned my face but it did hell hydrate my face and soothe the redness on a couple pimples I had. I was planning to give it three stars but since it did hell with readiness bumped it up to four. 
80494426, On AC Clear Treatment Mask ,Chyna,Combination,25-35," If you're going to get a sheet mask, get a Leaders sheet mask. These things are seriously sorcery. Love love love! "
80494426, On AC Clear Treatment Mask ,Rita V.,Combination,35-44, I love it! 
80494426, On AC Clear Treatment Mask ,Melissa S.,Combination,35-44," Every mask from this brand is outstanding and this one makes my top three list. I use a sheet mask daily, and whenever I use this one my skin is glowing the next morning. Don't just buy one because you'll see an immediate difference. Enjoy! "
80494426, On AC Clear Treatment Mask ,Cristin C.,Combination,35-44," I really like this mask, very soothing! "
104208431, On Galactomyces Pure Vitamin C Glow Toner ,Alexus,Combination,18-24," I bought this along with the matching serum because one of the main issues with my skin was my uneven skin tone. I had white splotches on my forehead that really bothered me. This set did my skin wonders even though I have trouble with being super consistent with my skincare routine. I don't even see the white splotches anymore and of course, it helped with the rest of my face too! 10/10 totally recommend! "
104208431, On Galactomyces Pure Vitamin C Glow Toner ,K.K,Oily,25-35, Vitamin C is one of my favorite ingredients! Love this toner and recommended to my friends. 
104208431, On Galactomyces Pure Vitamin C Glow Toner ,Seijal R.,Combination,35-44, Perfect for every types of skin. It’s the best toner i have used till today. Thanks soko glam 
104208431, On Galactomyces Pure Vitamin C Glow Toner ,Rita V.,Combination,35-44, I feel it leaves my skin amazing and radiant! I have a glow to my skin. I love it! 
140850764, On Mugwort Calming Toner ,Charolyn M.,Dry,18-24, I have dry/sensitive. My skin feels so nice after using this. 
140850764, On Mugwort Calming Toner ,Dev C.,Combination,25-35, This feels so nice on the skin. It’s a pretty watery consistency but it actually feels moisturizing when you put it on your skin. A little goes a long way. 
140850764, On Mugwort Calming Toner ,peachy1,Combination,25-35, I love love this toner so much! I’ve noticed it really helps with my acne and soothes my skin. 
140850764, On Mugwort Calming Toner ,CE,Dry,25-35," Personally, I did not see any visible difference after using this toner. I do have sensitive and reactive skin and it does not bother it in any way and feels nice to put on my face in the morning but nothing wow worthy. "
140850764, On Mugwort Calming Toner ,Desirae,Combination,25-35, This is the one! Done with all others. Never going back. My skin is thriving because of this. I want mugwort everything!! 
40668400, On Blueberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Rasa,Combination,25-35," I love it so much ,and I like the smell. I love my skin feeling after use it. I recommend it ! "
40668400, On Blueberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," I like this face wash a lot. I use it at night as a double cleanse after an oil cleanser. It is kinda perfect for that, but I found it to be slightly too drying for morning use. Cleanses well and is gentle on the skin "
40668400, On Blueberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Robin E.,Combination,45-55, Love this cleanser. I’ve been using the green tea version and decided to switch it up. So glad I tried this one 
40668400, On Blueberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Laura S.,Normal,45-55, Doesn’t strip moisture from your skin. Deep cleans yet skin doesn’t feel tight. 
40668400, On Blueberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Rebecca R.,Dry,25-35, its a classic. i love this line of cleansers and this one specifically is my favorite. I have very dry skin that is prone to hormonal acne and it never lets me down. 
140973461, On Mugwort Calming Clay Mask ,Nic,Sensitive,35-44," Acne prone skin, ended up damaging skin barrier due to new acne treatment, so needed mask that wouldn't further irritate and attack active acne and blackheads, gentle and effective. Didn't cause any further damage and use it once a week. Washes off easily too! "
140973461, On Mugwort Calming Clay Mask ,jasmine20,Combination,18-24," Loved this mask does dry me out a little, but leaves my skin so smooth "
140973461, On Mugwort Calming Clay Mask ,nikki m.,Dry,18-24, good for exfoliating 
140973461, On Mugwort Calming Clay Mask ,Bre,Oily,18-24," THISSSS MASK!!! okay I have combination skin, it gets oily through out the day. I also have sensitive skin but this skin doesn't give me any bad reaction or break me out. It actually makes my skin feel so soft and has brightened my red marks on my cheek from pimples and blackheads i've picked at. (BAD IK LOL) I recomend this mask for anybody who has oily and sensitive skin! "
140973461, On Mugwort Calming Clay Mask ,Desirae,Combination,25-35, You need this! I have dry combo skin and am hesitant using bentonite because of how stripped it tends to leave my face but this mask didn't. After just one use my blackheads are hardly visible and my skin is super clear. Love it!! Can't wait to keep using it. 
85450057, On Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," One of my favorites, my skin feels so soft after use and it’s really good at clearing the dry skin patches gently without having to scrub or use harsher physical exfoliants. My skin doesn’t feel dried out after use which some others do. "
85450057, On Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel ,Adrienne,Combination,45-55, Best one I have ever tried 
85450057, On Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel ,Ana,Dry,18-24, Decent overall 
85450057, On Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel ,Jess,Combination,45-55, It’s a gentle exfoliator and I love how my skin feels afterwards. 
85450057, On Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel ,Ginger P.,Dry,35-44," This peeling gel replaced ExfoliKate in my weekly routine and I think I like it more! Especially at this price point, it does an amazing job and my early 40s skin stays super smooth using it once a week before a sheet mask. Absolutely a winner! "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Shelby P.,Combination,18-24," All products seem to work good, but the serum and essence leave a sticky or tacky feeling on my face after. "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Dana K.,Normal,25-35," Have honestly only used this set so far for three days, but can already see the difference in my skin's overall appearance. Definitely a well curated set for normal skin types! "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Rachel,Normal,18-24, I must admit to slacking on my skincare this past year. So I decided to get back into this month with a designated routine. This set is amazing for those with Normal Skin. I seriously cannot love the oil cleansing pads enough! They are my favorite product in this set. My skin has no reaction to them and just feels amazingly clean afterwards. PRO TIP: Take a page straight out of Charlotte Cho's Book and massage your face at this point before rinsing it off. Literally the reason why it's my favorite step.  
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,CatTate,Normal,45-55,"The Egg-Zyme cleanser is the only product I'm debating on switching out. (Routines are not a one size fits all and I knew going in I might have to swap out a product or two). This cleanser just makes my face feel SQUEAKY clean but a bit too tight. It also has a slight small that some may find irritating on the skin. They clay mask also feels good. If you've tried the Aztec clay mask that was trendy, this has a similar feel.  "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Amanda A.,Normal,18-24,"I love the Toner Pads, but I might be biased due to the Vitamin C and its smell. The Essence and Serum are nice -- but might swap them out for another product only to pick one that's targeted for a specific skin concern. And it's hard not to love a good sheet mask but I feel like you can swap for a cute face mask if you want.  "
330333545, On Plant-Rich Antioxidant Pore Cleansing Oil ,Sarah,Normal,25-35, I was looking for a great oil based cleanser to start my double cleansing journey. I love how light and calming this is for the first step of my routine. 
330333545, On Plant-Rich Antioxidant Pore Cleansing Oil ,Jp,Combination,18-24, This works amazing!! I love this and I pair it with The Klog soft foaming polish scrub and my skin always feels amazing and looks fantastic! Love love love 
330333545, On Plant-Rich Antioxidant Pore Cleansing Oil ,Carrie,Dry,35-44," I was in the market for a new face wash and decided to take a chance on this one, and I'm glad I did. Not only is the price point decent, but you also get a good amount in the bottle for what you pay. The pore-cleansing oil feels very silky when you're using it. I tried it two different ways. The first was by taking my makeup off and then washing my face with the cleansing oil. The result was incredible, your face feels silky and smooth, the makeup is cleared from your pores, and you can see how clean your face is, as well as feel it. The second way I cleaned my face was to not remove my makeup first. This way really put the product to the test, but it really works. The pore-cleansing oil makes it look like it melts the makeup off of your face as you're washing it. The results are almost identical. You do get a better cleanse by removing your makeup first. For example, stubborn mascara, things like that. But if you're just too lazy or not feeling well, you can still wash your face with just the cleansing oil, and it will still take it off. You might just have to use an extra pump of the face wash. Personally, I think that's pretty impressive when other face washes I've tried can't even do that. "
330333545, On Plant-Rich Antioxidant Pore Cleansing Oil ,Belkys R.,Combination,45-55, An excelent product to wash your face and make it feel soft 
330333545, On Plant-Rich Antioxidant Pore Cleansing Oil ,Jessica H.,Combination,25-35, I used to hate the feeling of any oil on my skin so I was skeptical about using this at first. I was surprised how much I love it! It feels refreshing rather than greasy and it leaves my skin smooth and clean. 
236159082, On Ginseng Serum ,Tetyana W.,Dry,45-55, Perfect for my skin 
236159082, On Ginseng Serum ,Nicole D.,Normal,55+," I enjoy this serum so much. To me, it just feels so luxurious. I use it day and night and it really hydrates my skin. There’s a slight hint of ginseng fragrance but it’s nice. "
236159082, On Ginseng Serum ,Ava,Sensitive,18-24," I saw many great review about this product. However, after finishing the whole bottle I would not consider repurchasing it because I did not see a big difference or improvement on my skin. Great ingredients but not much results. "
225888691, On Theraffin Hand Mask ,Roxanne C.,Normal,25-35," This was very good for my skin, but it left a tacky residue on my hands for a long time (too much glycerin?). Nonetheless, left my hands soft afterward. I just wished the gloves would be biodegradable! "
225888691, On Theraffin Hand Mask ,Jennifer S.,Combination,35-44, I got these as a gift after my mother saw me using a set. Going to be part of her Valentine’s gift this year. 
225888691, On Theraffin Hand Mask ,M D.,Normal,18-24, My hands are the driest they have ever been. This mask helped so much and there is a definite difference. Thank you !!!! 
225888691, On Theraffin Hand Mask ,Caressa S.,Combination,45-55," These masks are the real deal, super moisturizing, and keeps your hands looking great! Great scent! "
225888691, On Theraffin Hand Mask ,Mo,Dry,25-35," These are great before bed, I often have trouble sleeping because of dry hands but this really locked moisture in and it’s a relaxing spa routine to keep these gloves on for a half an hour. I put hand lotion on after and it worked well for me. "
179164636, On Fundamental Water Gel Cream ,Solveig,Combination,25-35," I will say this product makes my skin feel really nice. I have combination type skin, and typically my skin has a hard time absorbing product. I use this as my nighttime moisturizer since I do feel that it takes longer for this to absorb on my face, however, it still feels very light and not thick at all. With that being said, my only dislike is that it has a slight chemical smell to it that I would prefer if there was no smell at all. "
179164636, On Fundamental Water Gel Cream ,sarah,Combination,35-44," La texture est top ! Très agréable sur la peau, elle pénétre rapidement sans effet gras ni collant. Même pour les peaux mixtes comme la mienne ! La peau est douce et nourrie. Elle est adaptée aux peaux sensibles. "
179164636, On Fundamental Water Gel Cream ,Kaylene C.,Combination,25-35, Instant hydration for the days where my skin is dry. Very lightweight and smooth on skin. Definitely will be adding this product to my daily routine. 
179164636, On Fundamental Water Gel Cream ,meredith,Dry,18-24," I wanted to like this product so badly. I love Klairs and the vitamin C serum works well for me so I thought this product would too. I have pretty dry skin and I read mostly good reviews. However, this product hurt my skin!! It was painful and stinging after I put it on, and my skin started breaking out and having a lot more discoloration. I was sad because I love Klairs. I am not sure why it didn't work for me but I hope it does for others. "
170123009, On Fundamental Nourishing Eye Butter ,M,Oily,25-35," This is such a nice eye cream. It keeps my under eye skin calm and soothed without being sticky, too heavy, or not heavy enough. It's easy to pat in and absorbs qiucly, stays smooth under makeup. This is a routine repurchase for me. "
170123009, On Fundamental Nourishing Eye Butter ,Jacinta,Sensitive,18-24, Didn't notice crazy difference in the fine lines on my undereyes but it was hydrating. Have sensitive skin and it did not irritate my skin. 
170123009, On Fundamental Nourishing Eye Butter ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," Light and moisturizing, great for everyday use. But I didn’t notice much of a difference compared to my normal moisturizer. The texture is a little on the light side, but I guess I was wanting something a little thicker and more overtly moisturizing. I still use it, just not the eye cream of my dreams. "
170123009, On Fundamental Nourishing Eye Butter ,sarah,Combination,35-44, J'aime beaucoup ce contour des yeux. La texture pénétre rapidement dans la peau sans effet gras ni collant. Le contour des yeux est hydraté. Il est adapté aux peaux sensibles. 
170123009, On Fundamental Nourishing Eye Butter ,El.,Combination,25-35, This eye cream has a wonderful texture and absorbed really well into my skin. This is one of the first eye creams I ever tried and I found it to be very hydrating and improved the quality of my skin. It never broke me out or irritated the sensitive skin around my eyes. There's a good amount of product in the tube and it lasted a really long time for me. It has great ingredients and I love that it's vegan and cruelty free. I'm loving Klairs and all of their products I've tried. It is slowly becoming my favorite brand. This is definitely worth repurchasing! I would recommend trying this if you struggle with sensitive skin or are just starting out on your skin care journey! 
62640216, On Acsen Pore Control Mask ,Juli,Dry,35-44, My skin is so soft after using this 
62640216, On Acsen Pore Control Mask ,Suzanne J.,Normal,18-24," A little drying, but overall good mask. "
62640216, On Acsen Pore Control Mask ,Juli r.,Sensitive,35-44," I feel like it’s working to pores, skin goes after and is not dried out "
62640216, On Acsen Pore Control Mask ,Lisa,Sensitive,25-35," I've only been able to use this mask twice so far and I have sensitive combination skin for reference (oil on my chin/jaw/hairline but dry forehead and cheeks). I was really excited to use this because I'm going through a flare up of hormonal acne and my pores are looking rough since the summer months are coming up where I live and it's humid. I love the way my skin looks after using this mask, I can't use it everywhere unfortunately because it burns really badly on my cheeks and forehead but the parts I can use it on when it's removed look so flawless. My complexion is even and the acne, while it isn't gone, is certainly dulled down significantly considering a single use. My second time using it I did decide to sleep in it to see if time made a difference and leaving it on overnight on problematic areas was beneficial. I asked a question about the sensitivity on here and support was very quick to get in touch with me and they were extremely kind. I couldn't return the product due to a site error and they helped me find an alternative mask for sensitive skin types, guided me on continuing to use this mask since I did like it's results and even gave me a gift card for the site issue/skin reaction which wasn't necessary but very kind of them.  "
62640216, On Acsen Pore Control Mask ,Gracia M.,Normal,35-44,"I urge you to try the product if you have really oily skin because it's working great in my oil spots where breakouts happen. Also, to address other reviews I read: yes there's a decently strong fragrance but I think it's strong simply because it's being applied on your face (near your nose too) and the smell is pretty floral/clean and the mask does cause intense skin tightening but I kind of like my mask to do that so I know it's dry and getting everything out of my skin (it is a clay mask, after all). "
136923293, On Aloe Real Cool Soothing Gel ,nancy h.,Normal,35-44," Ive been using this product with my red-light device thing, and absorbs great! No stickiness at all, with nice cooling effect. Have not tried on sun-kissed skin yet, though "
136923293, On Aloe Real Cool Soothing Gel ,Kev,Combination,18-24," Its so affordable and comes with so much product! It is such a great overall product for moisturizing, nourishing, and even reducing burns from the skin. Great product! "
136923293, On Aloe Real Cool Soothing Gel ,Minyuan H.,Normal,35-44," I buy this every year because let’s face it, this is a must for everyone, especially for warmer months. If you sunbathe, you definitely need to put this on afterwards to keep your skin soft and looking young. I use it all over my body and can be used on the face as well. "
136923293, On Aloe Real Cool Soothing Gel ,Alexandra C.,Combination,18-24, I use this as a pre-moisturizing step before my regular moisturizer and I've noticed that the combination makes my skin feel just a bit softer than usual. I also love how light is it. 
136923293, On Aloe Real Cool Soothing Gel ,koleelor,Combination,25-35," i love this. i tried the nature republic version but they have alcohol in it so it leaves my face feeling super dried out, but this one does not do that. it doesn't leave a sticky feeling either. it absorbs into my skin nicely and it's lightweight. i use it a lot during the winter when my face is the most dehydrated. i usually use it after my serum, before my moisturizer. "
159155824, On Waterfall Glacier Water Cream ,Rachel C.,Combination,25-35, I am a licensed esthetician. Korean and Japanese skincare never cease to amaze me. This moisturizer can be used on all skin types. It does an impeccable job at keeping hydration from serums and essences locked in for a long period of time. I used it AM and PM and it lasted me a little longer than 2 months. 
159155824, On Waterfall Glacier Water Cream ,Darcy,Normal,25-35, I bought this as I love the facial scrub from this company and I wanted to try out other moisturizers.  
159155824, On Waterfall Glacier Water Cream ,Jessica S.,Combination,35-44,Pros: 
159155824, On Waterfall Glacier Water Cream ,Solveig,Combination,25-35,- Does not leave a smell 
208521215, On Real Aqua Balancing Cream ,Sally,Dry,45-55," I really like this moisturizer, but it comes in a jar that takes a long time to use up. After awhile, it seems not good to use something you've stuck your fingers into repeatedly, even though I airways use clean hands. I wish they'd use one of those vacuum sealed pump type of dispensers so it will stay pure longer. "
208521215, On Real Aqua Balancing Cream ,Erika,Dry,35-44," So light and soft, my skin just drinks this product in and feels great all day! "
208521215, On Real Aqua Balancing Cream ,C,Sensitive,55+," This is definitely a water-based product which is good for oily, combo and sensitive skin types. However, don’t expect it to be a deep moisturizer by no means. Better for summer months or perhaps more suitable oily skin types who don’t need a heavy type of cream. It works well without adding any greasiness. "
208521215, On Real Aqua Balancing Cream ,Lisa K.,Combination,45-55," Needed a light but moisturizing lotion. Found it! Not heavy at all. Goes on smooth and my skin feels nice and soft after. I can use it for both my night and morning routines. Night routine I go a little heavier with it. My skin is sometimes sensitive to the texture of products. Not with this one. And don’t forget the neck, chest and back of hands (I include these areas with my toner, essence, serums and creams. Makes a difference!) "
208521215, On Real Aqua Balancing Cream ,Anna,Combination,18-24, I have been using this moisturizer for over a year and bought multiple times. I needed something that was less of a water cream and slightly thicker. It’s super light weight and had cleared my skin after a couple weeks of using it. It’s not fragrant so I see it as a hypoallergenic moisturizer. My skin is sensitive and has broken out with the little of changes. I had attempted a different moisturizer before just for fun and my skin had reacted negatively. Once I returned to this moisturizer I cleared up. This isn’t a fancy moisturizer but the simplicity of it is great and it works. 
140973502, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Cream 12 ,leaux,Combination,25-35," Battling dehydrated skin, this helped so much. Not heavy weight which is also a plus for me. "
140973502, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Cream 12 ,Youa V.,Dry,35-44, My skin is super dry and this moisturizer works well on my skin! 
140973502, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Cream 12 ,Diane W.,Dry,25-35," Great basic moisturizer. I like to try new skincare products but this is a staple that I always like going back to, especially when I'm unhappy with my skin. It never irritates my skin and always feels good going on "
140973502, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Cream 12 ,Ruby L.,Dry,25-35," Saved my skin! I cannot go a day without it, it is that good! "
140973502, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Cream 12 ,Anamaria K.,Sensitive,35-44," Winter in Canada is brutal and with my sensitive skin, anything too rich breaks me out. This cream is just perfectly moisturizing, rich enough while having all the right ingredients. It takes me from winter until summer without needing to change. It's easily layered for more moisture and goes on lightly for just that touch of moisture without leading my skin wanting. "
255648323, On Galac Niacin Essence Mask ,nikki m.,Dry,No, Worked for my sensitive skin 
255648323, On Galac Niacin Essence Mask ,Anastasia,No,18-24," These are my go-to treat when I've been lazy and my skin is mad at me or irritated from hormones. It's like an undo button for bad habits and time itself. My tired eyes and chapped lips, creeping wrinkles are erased like literal magic. It leaves my skin with this buttery, silk finish that is stunning. Important night? Definitely doing one of these first. I use facial wash (cosmic dew) then toner (first essence rx) then a little serum (watermelon dew all over) *then* one of these masks. I try to not ""wash"" it off but just put a little water on my hands, wipe off the excess, then pat/air dry. Then I finish my routine with glow serum and lotion (super ceramide renewal cream). My dry sensitive skin doesn't stand a chance against these healers. (25yrs old) "
255648323, On Galac Niacin Essence Mask ,Erica J.,25-35,Dry, Yet another soothing and lovely face mask 
255648323, On Galac Niacin Essence Mask ,Candice,Normal,No, I love this brand haven't tried a product from them I haven't liked. This mask is perfect for when your skin starts breaking out helps clear it up quicker and didn't upset my already irritated skin 
255648323, On Galac Niacin Essence Mask ,sarah,No,25-35, got as a gift it works so amazing 
208520936, On pH Balancing Watery Cleansing Oil ,Gretchen G.,Combination,35-44," It works well. Doesn't dry out my skin and pairs nicely with the water cleansing gel. If anything, lasts twice as long as a bottle of that. "
208520936, On pH Balancing Watery Cleansing Oil ,May L.,Combination,35-44, I really did like it and gets better when my daily skin cleaning 
208520936, On pH Balancing Watery Cleansing Oil ,Sara,Combination,18-24," I'm new to double cleansing so before buying anything, I spoke to Lisa, one of their skin experts, and she recommended this product to me along with the cleansing gel. So coming from someone with acne who've tried almost everything before, I'm telling you this cleansing oil and the gel are the best ever. They work wonders on my skin, I definitely recommend! "
208520936, On pH Balancing Watery Cleansing Oil ,Anastasiia,Combination,25-35, I have a combinated type of skin. It`s my first time I have tried Acwell product. I will definitely buy it nex time when mine is run out. There is no artificial smells and it is perfectly suits me as I`m allergic to many fragrances and parfumes. The liquid is transparent. 
208520936, On pH Balancing Watery Cleansing Oil ,Sarah,Oily,25-35," I have adult hormonal acne with mostly oily combination skin. Buying skincare for myself has been tricky. I recently decided to try double washing, so I started using this before my regular face cleanser. My skin has been much less oily, clearer, and more even in tone. My makeup stays on better and for longer, too. I am thrilled and plan on repurchasing it when I need to - you only need a little to use for your whole face, so it'll take me a while to get through this bottle. "
136923308, On Soonjung Hydro Barrier Cream ,Sam,Combination,25-35," I have tried a few products with cica and the same thing happens each time...after using the moisturizer for about a week, my skin gets super irritated and red and sometimes it even burns. This moisturizer was no exception to that. The texture was only ok as well...I am not a fan of the sticky texture, but that is a personal preference. "
136923308, On Soonjung Hydro Barrier Cream ,Angelica O.,Sensitive,18-24, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
136923308, On Soonjung Hydro Barrier Cream ,Amelia O.,Normal,25-35," I have acne prone skin that gets very dry in the winter. I find that the skin around my nose and mouth especially, stings when I apply skincare but ever since I started using this moisturizer, I have noticed that my skin is much less sensitive. It never stings my skin so I would highly recommend it for people with sensitive skin! "
136923308, On Soonjung Hydro Barrier Cream ,Molly G.,Sensitive,18-24," I usually have normal skin but during the winter months I get pretty dry. I've been using this as a dry cream and it's been great. Non-scented, thick and works well under sunscreen. "
231710599, On Comfort Barrier Cream ,Samantha R.,Combination,18-24," Oh my gosh, it definitely does what it says in terms of repairing you skin carrier. I use this pretty much every night and I wake up with very hydrated and plump skin. It is thick but feels cooling and everytime I put it on, I feel like my skin rejoicing. I use retinol and bha so this cream is amazing in protecting my skin and not letting it get dry, sensitive, or irritated. Sometimes if I happen to skin my night routine, I'll use it in the morning and dilute it with some toner which brings it back to life. "
231710599, On Comfort Barrier Cream ,Maggie,Normal,18-24," I was looking for a moisturizer that was a bit thicker to protect my skin in the upcoming cold months. I used skinRx lab madecera cream last year and it was lovely, but i just couldn’t justify the price again to splurge this year. This was recommended by a soko glam team member during a skin concierge conversation so i decided to give it a go. It is just perfect! I’d compare it to be like a mix between skinRx lab’s made cera cream and for anyone that’s familiar, Freck. beauty’s RICH B*TCH moisturizer. It’s thick and dewy but not overly so where I can comfortably wear it during the day without looking greasy, just wonderfully dewy. It may be a bit too much for those with oily skin, or combo skin in the summer time, but personally im very pleased with this for the winter months at least. "
231710599, On Comfort Barrier Cream ,Morgan,Dry,25-35," This may be my favourite moisturizer yet. My skin has never felt softer and more plump. I live in a harsh climate and have dehydrated skin. Usually nothing touches my dryness, especially in winter. Enter this.  "
231710599, On Comfort Barrier Cream ,Kayty V.,Dry,25-35,"You barely need anything, it spreads so well and soaks in within 5 minutes. I use it when my skin feels tight or before an event when I wear makeup and it just calms and soothes my skin. New favourite! "
231710599, On Comfort Barrier Cream ,Nia,Dry,25-35," It feels so soft and hydrating on my face, and a little goes a long way! My new go-to moisturizer for my morning routine! "
61260397, On SoonJung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm ,Taylor B.,Dry,25-35, i use this to slug in the summer—it does a great job of locking in moisture but not being too heavy or clogging like vaseline can be. it's very light and non-sticky while hydrating and soothing very well. 
61260397, On SoonJung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm ,olivia,Dry,25-35, i tried this after using the 2x intensive cream and i prefer this as a moisturizer a lot more. it keeps my skin so freaking hydrated and clear 
61260397, On SoonJung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm ,Liana,Dry,25-35," I use just a dab of this on the red areas around my nose every night and it works wonders to calm my skin and reduce reduce redness. It's particularly helpful on the nights I use a retinoid, but it is also a great compliment to my regular moisturizer. "
61260397, On SoonJung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm ,Cynthia H.,Sensitive,25-35, This creamy but not heavy formula is perfect for my sensitive skin 
61260397, On SoonJung 5-Panthensoside Cica Balm ,Eber L.,Combination,18-24," Very thick, use it when my skin feels extra dry "
24751052, On 5-Step Combination Skin Set ,Leah,Combination,25-35," I really like the serum in this set but I feel like my skin has gotten worse since using this product combo. Specifically, having more breakouts, uneven tone, and dullness. Not sure if it's just the toner (which I've noticed causes more redness on my skin) or some combination of ingredients. "
24751052, On 5-Step Combination Skin Set ,Sammie J.,Combination,25-35,We are sorry to hear that the products didn't work for you. Please reach out to us via email at 
24751052, On 5-Step Combination Skin Set ,Berlyn,Oily,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
155746016, On Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence ,Stephanie B.,Combination,25-35, My face is sun sensitive and burns so easily. This is amazing because I have never been burnt! It is so light weight so it’s great for layering and smells so clean. The slight shimmer helps my skin appear radiant and healthy. I wear it alone and also use it as part of my skin prep for makeup. 
155746016, On Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence ,coco,Dry,45-55," I love everything about this magical potion. I am religious about SPF and don’t like to wear anything heavy on my face. As a result, I’m always on the hunt for the perfect BB cream or tinted moisturizer that gives me all of the sun protection and light coverage without suffocating my skin. This fits the bill. It evens out my skin tone without hiding it, and it gives me an absolutely gorgeous (natural) glow. This is the holy grail for me. (Side note: it does have a bit of scent to it which may turn some off. I’m usually fairly sensitive to stuff like that but somehow am not bothered here) "
155746016, On Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence ,Ling,Dry,25-35," I do not really notice the shimmer, so if you are looking for something easily noticeable, this is not it. But it is super hydrating, light, and a little goes a long way with this tube. I have ordered this twice so far and it has worked for me in the spring and summer! "
155746016, On Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence ,Luyen N.,Combination,25-35, I love how light this feels…and the shimmer is really subtle! 
155746016, On Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence ,Nicole,Combination,25-35," I’ve been using this sunscreen every day forever now and it’s the best ever, most of the time now I even wear it in place of makeup, because it’s made my skin look so much better that now I don’t need foundation or tinted moisturizer- the sheer glow on this is enough, although it wears incredibly well under makeup. One of the first sunscreens I’ve used that truly agrees with my skin, doesn’t clog my pores or leave a white cast and I feel like it’s just made an overall improvement in my skin "
49889646, On Triplex Natural Shampoo ,KKim,Combination,35-44," After I started using this shampoo and conditioner, I began to experience major hair loss. Initially, I thought it was from stress, but once I stopped using it, hair loss was extremely less. This was just my own experience. I believe this product is made with sulfates. I would not recommend this product. "
49889646, On Triplex Natural Shampoo ,Kati,Oily,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this shampoo did not work for you, and that you experienced hair loss. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences:) "
49889646, On Triplex Natural Shampoo ,ANA,Combination,18-24, Cleans without drying out your scalp. 
330333906, On Double Action Exfoliating Cleanser ,Evan K.,Combination,25-35, I love the cooling sensation this wash gives. It doesn’t feel at all like an exfoliator which I was hoping for a little more of BUT I still really like it. I feel like it gives a deep clean without the squeaky dry feeling afterwards. 
330333906, On Double Action Exfoliating Cleanser ,JiaLin,Oily,25-35," Creamy gel cleanser, yet doesn't have the cool sensation as mentioned in the description. Feels like a normal cleanser with no wow factor. "
330333906, On Double Action Exfoliating Cleanser ,Mila,Dry,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
81312412, On Natural Brightening Velvet Mask (6 pack) ,Chona,Sensitive,35-44, I was surprised how this mask works well on my sensitive skin. It did not results to any break out at all. I would recommend this if you have sensitive skin. It’s worth it. 
81312412, On Natural Brightening Velvet Mask (6 pack) ,Thea M.,Dry,25-35, I bought different types of masks on the Black Friday sale and this one was one of the best. My skin looked so hydrated and bright afterward. The quality of the sheet is outstanding also. I will repurchase. 
81312412, On Natural Brightening Velvet Mask (6 pack) ,K.K.,Dry,Dry," I've been eyeing these for a while but they were out of stock at one point and I was so bummed. Now that I've had a chance to try them, I understand why they were sold out! I love the milky essence and I think my skin tends to get more benefit out of that vs. a clearer/thin essence. the material is really nice. I can't say I've noticed a strong brightening effect but I've really only used one pack so not expecting the world here. Will repurchase! "
81312412, On Natural Brightening Velvet Mask (6 pack) ,Lil M.,Combination,55+," This is my second time to purchase, and I will probably get more in the future. They leave my skin feeling firmer and very smooth "
81312412, On Natural Brightening Velvet Mask (6 pack) ,Maya,Oily,25-35, It literally makes my pores disappear! 
144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,jennifer,Sensitive,18-24," I have partially sensitive, dry skin and acne. Most skincare products I use are usually mediocre and have little to no effects on my skin but this product has amazing effects. when I use it at night, I wake up glowing the next day, making me feel like I don't need to moisturize again. overall great to use at least once a week. buying again!! "
144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,India W.,Sensitive,18-24, I absolutely love this product! Each pad contains a lot of product and it worked wonders for my skin. My husband uses it as well and is really enjoying it! 
144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,Rachel S.,Combination,35-44, Helps clear up any under the skin acne I'm experiencing without being too harsh on my sensitive skin. 
144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,Kim,Sensitive,25-35," A little pricey for just 20 pads, but it's a really nice treatment. The pads are huge, the size of my palm. And they're dripping w/the essence. I've tried using the essence w/o the pad but find that I get better results when I use both sides of the pad instead of just patting the essence into my skin. Was surprised to see improvements in my skin texture so quickly even though it's super gentle. A really nice treat for my skin. "
185927357, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Exfoliating AHA Treatment ,Anna N.,Oily,25-35, Have been using once a week for over 4 months. Exfoliates well but no change to pores yet. Great for maintaining my already soft skin. 
185927357, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Exfoliating AHA Treatment ,Stephanie C.,Normal,>55," At first. However, The gentle exfoliation you get from this product is magnificent. You do need to stick with consistent usage of 2 to 3 days per week to see the benefits. "
185927357, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Exfoliating AHA Treatment ,Rosa,Dry,Dry, I have been using this AHA treatment for about 2 months and love how gentle it is. I use it once or twice a week as recommended and it leaves my skin smooth without irritation. A little also goes a long way so I expect this bottle will last me a year! 
185927357, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Exfoliating AHA Treatment ,Jane O.,Sensitive,35-44, Ive been using various a anti-aging toners and i think this is my new fav! My skin looks more even and glowy. It does not irritate my skin. 
185927357, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Exfoliating AHA Treatment ,K,Dry,35-44, Smooths uneven skin texture. Finished my first bottle and realized just how effective this is for my skin while waiting for my second bottle to arrive.  
179145809, On Probiotics Double Action Serum ,Dennis H.,Combination,18-24," From the innovation of a 2-1, to the eye candy of the amazing ingredients this serum has. Everything about this product made me fall in love. It’s also never too early for anti aging, and I’ve been using this serum every night for about 2 months now. My skin feels so hydrated and a noticeable difference in my complexion. I love that it has lactic acid (AHA) in its formulation, to help exfoliate your skin. "
179145809, On Probiotics Double Action Serum ,Elizabeth C.,Combination,25-35," I started using this two weeks ago, and my face has felt both moisturized and looks brighter. This is in a must in my summer routine. "
179145809, On Probiotics Double Action Serum ,L A.,Combination,18-24," It absorbs quickly and does not just sit on the skin. Just a personal problem, but it is always hard to get an even amount of product from each side. "
179145809, On Probiotics Double Action Serum ,Vivian P.,Combination,18-24, I’ve been waiting to try this serum since it’s a two in one plus joanday recommended! I love it so far 
179145809, On Probiotics Double Action Serum ,Kyle W.,Combination,35-44, It's so light weight. A little goes a long way. 
136923255," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist ",Joo,Sensitive,35-44, I have sensitive eczema prone skin. This burns while I apply it. Unfortunately had to throw away. 
136923255," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist ",Lily,Dry,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this mist did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
136923255," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Ampule Mist ",Melody G.,Dry,55+," I am so glad I bought this, it is so light but moisturizing. Love using in between my serum and moisturizer. "
105213987, On Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner ,Anahi R.,Combination,25-35," The flower petals alone is what drawn me to this product. It was something different that I wanted to try, especially with hibiscus. It was pretty hydrating and provide good antioxidant properties. For the claim on acne and anti-aging, I don't think I've seen results in that area. But if you want a hydrating toner with some antioxidant boost, then this is it. "
105213987, On Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner ,Barbara B.,Sensitive,55+," I like to try new things, but sometimes you just hit on things you can't do without. This is one of those for me. It's the perfect way to start my care routine both morning and night. "
105213987, On Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner ,Cindy,Normal,>55, I really like the toner it is light and very refreshing 
105213987, On Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner ,Vanessa,Normal,25-35," This was not for me. The texture feels oddly grainy and after consistent use, I haven't noticed any change in my skin. It felt like I was just rubbing tap water on my face "
105354044, On Aloe Hyaluron Cream ,Cat,Dry,18-24," Loved this product, rich and creamy! The only complaint is the price, too much for the amount of product you get in my opinion. "
105354044, On Aloe Hyaluron Cream ,Deborah L.,Combination,45-55, Perfect 
105354044, On Aloe Hyaluron Cream ,pinkkitten,Dry,18-24, It absorbs pretty well. It calmed my skin down and when paired with an acne cream it didn't react. I woke up and my skin was moisturized....not like dewy how I would want but it felt and looked really good. A bit small hence the 4 stars but I know it'll go a long way. Perfect for an easy calming moisturizer. I might pair this with another thicker cream to really moisturize my skin. 
105354044, On Aloe Hyaluron Cream ,Cynthia,Combination,55+," I receive Ipsy monthly actually yearly. I was introduced to this product thru Ipsy. I am retired fashion, make up, hair etc designer cosmetologist for over 40yrs here in Texas. This is one of the Best worthy products including ingredients etc. I have had the pleasure of using and now investing for it. Stay safe. CGR "
105354044, On Aloe Hyaluron Cream ,Kasey H.,Sensitive,25-35," Very rich, my skin feels so dewy and hydrated in the mornings. I don’t think I’ll live without this now that I’ve tried it! "
42283341, On Dear Hydration Boosting Cream ,A,Combination,25-35," I buy this 2 at a time so I never run out. My skin loves it, I always feel hydrated after using it. It is a thicker moisturizer but absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling soft. Would be great if they offered a larger container "
42283341, On Dear Hydration Boosting Cream ,Heidi,Dry,18-24, I am 24 with dry/sensitive skin. This is by far the worst moisturizer I have ever used. I would use a drug store product before using this again. This cream does not provide my skin with any hydration at all. It is extremely oily on my skin and takes forever to absorb. My skins stays greasy all day and that is rare for how dry my skin is. I cannot put makeup on at all when using this product. The scent is unpleasant as well. I would not recommend this product to anyone! 
42283341, On Dear Hydration Boosting Cream ,Sandra M.,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Dorine C.,Sensitive,55+," Since there were so many good reviews on this toner, I decided to give it a try. My skin is sensitive & slightly oily. I did not have any adverse reaction to it...which is good...have been using it for a week. It hasn't ""wowed"" me yet. For now, I would say it's an okay toner. "
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Dev C.,Combination,18-24, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Stephanie B.,Combination,25-35," This toner is perfect. It is $23, but for 500 ml, this will surely last. I love its milky texture, and how you don’t need to use a lot of product to get your entire face saturated in it. My face feels so smooth after using it. "
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Anastasiia,Sensitive,45-55," I love this toner. It makes my skin so soft, plump, and dewy. It feels a little bit more like a super liquidy lotion so I tend to put a light toner on first then follow it with this toner. "
62436308, On Acsen TOC Toner ,Eva P.,Sensitive,18-24, This toner really surprised me. At first it didn't feel like it did much but over time I noticed my face felt smoother and the redness from my rosacea went down dramatically. It's a bit drying though so you need a good moisturizer to follow. This also helped control a lot of the whiteheads which was something I have really struggled to do. 
62436308, On Acsen TOC Toner ,Rebecka G.,Combination,25-35, First time really using a toner and I like the results! 
62436308, On Acsen TOC Toner ,Caitlin T.,Oily,25-35," So far over the past two weeks, this toner has significantly improved my skin texture, started to heal and decrease my hormonal acne around my jawline, and I have had absolutely NO sensitivity to it whatsoever! I use it just at night before my moisturizer. "
62436308, On Acsen TOC Toner ,Ari,Combination,18-24," This toner and the Oil Cut Cleanser were my first experience with the Troiareuke line. I’ve continued to purchase and use the Acsen cleanser since August 2020, but I can’t say the same for this toner. While there’s nothing overtly wrong with this product, I just felt like it wasn’t doing anything for my skin. It felt nice, but I just didn’t see any benefits from it. "
62436308, On Acsen TOC Toner ,Lina J.,Combination,18-24, it's the best thing ever my skin cleared up so well after i started using it. My only advice is to let it absorb well before applying other products over it as it would sting a bit. 
170123007, On Fundamental Eye Awakening Gel ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," This works better to refresh your puffy eyes in the morning than as a long term solution which I think is what it is intended for. Which it does very well for me. A very light texture to it, doesn’t feel like I have it on which is a plus. "
170123007, On Fundamental Eye Awakening Gel ,Eleanora S.,Combination,25-35," Feels refreshing and hydrating, and doesn't go on heavy/greasy or make me break out. "
170123007, On Fundamental Eye Awakening Gel ,Ling,Combination,35-44, Bought this for anti aging and it is very light weight and doesn't cause bumps like the other eye creams BUT I didn't notice anything different after 2 weeks of using this. It didn't get worse but it didn't get better. Maybe I should use it longer before noticing a change? 
170123007, On Fundamental Eye Awakening Gel ,Tristan,Dry,25-35,But I probably wouldn't get this again. 
81312473, On Dr.Althea Essential Skin Conditioner Silk Mask (5 pack) ,Jennifer C.,Combination,45-55, These are okay. They leave skin feeling soft and silky smooth but they're very drippy. You spend the whole time wiping upwards because it leaks down the face while on. 
81312473, On Dr.Althea Essential Skin Conditioner Silk Mask (5 pack) ,Rose,Sensitive,18-24," I love all of Dr Athlea’s products! It’s perfect — the gold packaging, the hydration, the gel texture . . . instantly one of my favorites after first time use. "
81312473, On Dr.Althea Essential Skin Conditioner Silk Mask (5 pack) ,Marissa T.,Combination,18-24," I love these masks so much- winter heat and traveling make my skin and lips so dry even when I am hydrating, but these masks always do the job in saving my face "
81312473, On Dr.Althea Essential Skin Conditioner Silk Mask (5 pack) ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," My friend got these for me as a gift a while ago, and once I used them all up I had to buy them again. They are definitely on the expensive side so I don't use them very often. However, when I feel like my skin needs some deep hydration I will definitely reach for one of these. The quality is so nice and it really feels like such a treat. "
81312473, On Dr.Althea Essential Skin Conditioner Silk Mask (5 pack) ,Nelyn D.,Dry,25-35, Tried one sachet so far but I love it. It has a lot of essence in the pack which was great so I used it all over. My skin felt hydrated even the next day. 
235840331, On Time Is Running Out Mist ,Joyce L.,Combination,No," The scent is light and dissipates quickly. Feels good and moisturizing on the face. Despite sensitive skin, no break outs. Also combination skin, but it does not make my oily sections oily. Just a good balance! "
235840331, On Time Is Running Out Mist ,Aly,No,25-35," After I wash my face in the morning I pat my skin dry (but still a tiny bit dampish), then spray this all over my face probably three quick passes. I LOVE IT. I really think this gets my skin ready for my serums, moisturizer and SPF. I use this basically as a toner and have noticed subtle changes. It has a very nature scent to it which keeps me coming back to it. I do not however suggest using this for moister during the day because it can look too shiny. "
235840331, On Time Is Running Out Mist ,neil,25-35,Combination," Listen, some nights I just feel way to lazy to do my full 7 step skincare routine, so on those nights, I cleanse, spray this, and have great skin still! Love the scent it has as well. "
235840331, On Time Is Running Out Mist ,Jesskin,Oily,No," I'm loving this mist!! It's so perfect for the cold weather. It's super hydrating, leaves this beautiful glow and the hydration feel lasts a while. I've become sensitive to scents as I've gotten older but love the citrus scent this has, and it doesn't linger for long. I've bought two full sizes during the sale and a mini travel one from another site since Soko doesn't carry it. I'm so happy I tired this mist, such a plus that this Sioris line is organic as well! A must try! "
235840331, On Time Is Running Out Mist ,Rae,No,25-35," I needed a new mist and was looking around, saw this and decided to pick it up. I know it seems a little counterproductive to add oil to your routine if you're oily but this is a good way to do so. This has help keep my face hydrated throughout the day that I was never an oil slick at the end of the day. Also the product is very light even the mist is super fine that it is refreshing. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. "
10715598, On The Little Book of Skin Care ,Alyssa F.,Oily,25-35," I read this book about 4 years ago and since applying what I’ve learned to my skin care routine, I’ve never looked back! My skin has never been better in my whole life! This book is a must for anyone interested in learning about skin care! "
10715598, On The Little Book of Skin Care ,Kalia L.,Dry,35-44, I'm surprised by how much I'm enjoying this book. I thought it would be useful but didn't anticipate it being fun to read. The description in the book is clear and honest and immersive - it almost has an erotic quality. Definitely has motivated me to make taking care of my skin a priority. 
10715598, On The Little Book of Skin Care ,JiaLin,Oily,25-35," A good start and good read to skincare, very informative. "
10715598, On The Little Book of Skin Care ,Sabrina,Combination,18-24, I love this book so much!! It is very informative and really helped me out with learning more about my skin! 10 out of 10 would recommend getting this book! Very helpful!  
10715598, On The Little Book of Skin Care ,Nathalia G.,Combination,25-35, Very happy with my purchase 
238343461, On Daily SPF ,JJ,Normal,18-24," I like that this is a physical, sustainable sunscreen that doesn't pill! "
238343461, On Daily SPF ,Alexah,Combination,25-35,"- Like: no pilling, lightweight, layers well "
238343461, On Daily SPF ,Vicky,Combination,25-35,"- Dislike: minor white cast (I have a light-medium skin tone), slightly sticky "
238343461, On Daily SPF ,Jennifer R.,Normal,>55, I wanted to like this but it leaves the worst feeling on your face in addition to the sickly white cast. Not only that but it’s nearly impossible to wear this under makeup without your makeup looking awful and pilling. Best way I could describe it is that body spf you use in the summer that never dries down and feels icky on you. 
80494446, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Cream ,Karen R.,Combination,>55," First time I tried this product was a sample , I fell in love with the silky feel on my face and neck. Absorbs nicely not sticky just silky smooth. "
80494446, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Cream ,Anna T.,35-44,35-44," I added this as final step in my nighttime routine and it did not disappoint. Since adding this product, even my aesthitician said that my skin is glowing. I go to bed looking like a glazed donut and wake up with smooth/moisturized skin everyday! For someone with sensitive skin with slight rosacea, this is the real deal. "
80494446, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Cream ,Zoraida S.,Combination,25-35, This is a must for anyone dealing with dry skin or just trying to make it through in a dry climate area. This moisturizer is potent! I use it at night and wake up with glowy skin that lasts throughout the day. The best part is that it works well with sensitive skin and does not have a harsh smell. 
80494446, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Cream ,kilikngo,Normal,25-35," I bought this bc of the good reviews, but it turned out different from what I expected. This moisturizer leaves my skin very oily and it is sticky even after a couple of hours in. I only use this at night time. The container is made of plastic and it feels cheap, same with the consistency of the moisturizer; it has a gel like texture. "
165043857, On Wonder Balm ,Vanessa L.,18-24,18-24," Works wonders! Leaves my hair shiny, tangle free, and soft. "
165043857, On Wonder Balm ,Cara,Normal,45-55," this does wonderful things for my long breakage prone hair. What I really love about this product is that it can be used in a variety of ways successfully. First can be used as a deep conditioning treatment after shampooing with a clarifying shampoo and left on for a length of time and rinsed out. Second it can be used as a regular conditioner left on after shampooing for however long you leave on your conditioner in the shower and then rinse out. Lastly it can be used as a leave in conditioner now this is where it gets really special- on wet hair or on dry as a smoothing balm. I tried to extend the life of my blown out hair and by Day four, My hair is screaming for more moisture. To survive that fourth day I will put some of this balm in- sometimes with a little water sometimes without. What can I say I’m a mad scientist. "
165043857, On Wonder Balm ,Michelle,Dry,18-24," i’ve bought many things from soko glam just for fun and honestly, most things didn’t work for me and was ultimately a waste of money. However, i’ve had this product for over a year (a little goes a long way) and it’s sooo good. I dye/bleach my hair pretty often and it can look really damaged and dry, but using this after a shower really helps. I also like how easy it is to use because I don’t have the patience to use products that have to be used in between the shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend this product! Your hair will look and feel sooo soft 😍 "
165043857, On Wonder Balm ,Daniel,Combination,25-35," This product lasts a while since I use it once or twice a week, but my hair is noticeably healthier especially with the scalp treatment. My hair feels thicker and softer throughout the week and it feels great. "
80494772, On 7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask ,jL,Combination,35-44," There’s a bit of a learning curve to this mask, it took me a minute to figure it out, but once it was on my face, I was in love. It fits and sticks to my face better than any mask I’ve tried, and there is SO much product in the packet that I used it the next morning. It left my skin feeling so hydrated and plump and glowing. I will buy this again and again. "
80494772, On 7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask ,Kb,Sensitive,45-55," Maybe it’s a good mask if you have a large, flat face. The aren’t enough cuts in it to adjust to fit the jaw and sides of the face. I’m disappointed because it’s a thick fiber and seems to be good quality. "
80494772, On 7 Wonders Tundra Cranberry Anti-Aging Mask ,Vivian P.,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
165043867, On Wonder Hair Oil ,Victoria,Dry,25-35," The change this has made to my hair is ridiculous! The amount of compliments I get on my hair nowwww, this is my first and last hair oil. my frizz is under control, and my hair is so shiny and soft. A little goes a real long way so be careful, or else it could look and feel oily instead. I use it when my hair is damp, before blow drying. "
165043867, On Wonder Hair Oil ,Rianna,Normal,25-35," I have fine, long hair, color treated at the ends. I found this made my hair incredibly soft and shiny - I use a little bit post-wash, pre-dry. I find it absorbs fine and doesn't leave any oiliness when I use it then. I use a larger amount pre-wash: rub into hair a few hours before showering, it doesn't absorb fast this way, but I think it contributes to keeping my hair moisturized and sleek! Love love love this hair oil. "
165043867, On Wonder Hair Oil ,Shirley J.,Combination,35-44," This might be a user error, but it makes my hair look greasy. My hair does look shinier but not in a good way. "
216340223, On Vita Duo Night Cream ,Vanessa R.,Dry,>55, Makes my skin feel like velvet 
216340223, On Vita Duo Night Cream ,Janice,Combination,25-35," I have been bouncing around moisturizers for some time now, and this one just was not it. It moisturized my skin but was nothing spectacular. Probably would not revisit this one. "
216340223, On Vita Duo Night Cream ,Stephanie,Combination,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
25868928, On Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion ,Christina K.,Dry,25-35, doesn't give me that greasy feeling that most body lotions do. definitely something I plan to keep in my routine. 
25868928, On Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion ,Jennifer L.,Dry,35-44, This absorbs quickly and leaves my skin moisturized but not greasy. 
25868928, On Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion ,s o.,Normal,>55, great lotion that is unscented & non-greasy. 
25868928, On Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion ,Sandra M.,Combination,25-35," Super fast absorbing, and unscented. No greasy feeling afterwards. I use it every day "
25868928, On Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion ,Nina G.,Dry,35-44, I have dry and sensitive skin and this lotion has been great! It is not greasy and keeps my skin moisturized and from drying out. I need to stock up on it when it is back in stock because it runs out fast. 
330333745, On Hydra Shield Anti-Pollution Jelly Toner ,Dunia H.,Dry,>55," I've got dry skin and when I use this toner, my skin feels nourished and supple for my old skin. Love it! "
330333745, On Hydra Shield Anti-Pollution Jelly Toner ,C,Dry,25-35," Looooove it! I originally used an AHA+BHA toner, but during the winter my skin had started peeling, flaking and my face was overall super textured. This product here? SAVED ME from having to deal with all the nastiness and gave me the much needed moisture that other products failed at! Will definitely come back and purchase! "
330333745, On Hydra Shield Anti-Pollution Jelly Toner ,Trishina R.,Dry,25-35, Wow. I am obsessed.  
330333745, On Hydra Shield Anti-Pollution Jelly Toner ,Casey,Dry,18-24,1. I love the applicator- so easy! 
330333745, On Hydra Shield Anti-Pollution Jelly Toner ,Arya M.,Dry,25-35,2. feels so good after cleansing. soft and silky  
24598223, On 5-Step Brightening Set ,Samra A.,Normal,35-44," Great value, as I bought this during the sale. All the products are great! "
24598223, On 5-Step Brightening Set ,Stephanie,Normal,18-24," I didn't know how to hand-select my skincare routine myself, so I went for this set...I am blown away by all of it! Especially the toner (so moisturizing) and the Klairs cream is making my skin so bright and glowy!! You won't regret giving this set a try if you're new to a full-out skincare regimen :) "
24598223, On 5-Step Brightening Set ,Sarah,Oily,35-44, all of them apart from Swanicoco Multi Solution Triple V Ampoule which didn't work well with my skin. Overall though great starting kit 
24598223, On 5-Step Brightening Set ,Tiphani S.,Normal,25-35," This was the first time that I used a full 5 steps like this and introduced me to toner, omg soo good ! Really gave me glass skin super hydrated, It did not get rid of my dark spot on the side of my eye and it’s been 6 mos so you probably need to use a vitamin c! "
24598223, On 5-Step Brightening Set ,Miss K.,Combination,35-44, My skin feels so much better! The products run out so quickly though - lol. Other than that they are amazing. No complaints. I will be purchasing again at the end of the month. I wish there was a whitening product in the pack though. 
224228728, On AHA-BHA-PHA Real Cica 92% Cool Calming Soothing Gel ,Angela O.,Combination,25-35," Light and absorbant. Tea tree and rosemary reminds me of eucalyptus. Has a pleasant scent with a clean finish my skin, absorbing fast and dries quickly. Comes in a generously sized container; I apply this gel to my shoulders and chest, too. I love it. Great for summer. "
224228728, On AHA-BHA-PHA Real Cica 92% Cool Calming Soothing Gel ,Suzy B.,Combination,18-24, I absolutely love the feeling of it and it is super hydrating! The best way to finish my routine. 
224228728, On AHA-BHA-PHA Real Cica 92% Cool Calming Soothing Gel ,Banana b.,Oily,18-24," I use this moisturizer every other night, ( I have 2 moisturizers) and I normally use this one with my exfoliating toner and my hydrating essence and a hydrating serum. My skin drinks this moisturizer up. "
224228728, On AHA-BHA-PHA Real Cica 92% Cool Calming Soothing Gel ,Shylo N.,Oily,35-44," I wanted to buy this product for some time now, but never thought I needed it that desperately in my skincare. Until I saw Euni feature it in one of her videos where she used it to kind of refresh her scalp. And I knew I HAD TO try it out. See, I have seborrheic dermatitis all over my front hairline and although I do use a medicated shampoo, I also need to and have used countless products to apply during those in-between wash days, which is when the condition makes my skin really itchy, scaly and irritated. Unfortunately nothing calms all that irritation...until now. I had to put this really to the test under different conditions my scalp was in and had the same results. I haven't had any irritation in two weeks, the itchiness is a bit better and as long as I keep applying it 2 to 3 times a week, I get no noticeable flakes. It does freshen up and soothes my scalp until it's time to wash it. But even better, all that relief allows me to sleep better at night and not be so self conscious of how my hairline looks during the day. So, thanks to Euni for talking about it on her channel, to you Soko Glam for featuring it in your site, and to Some By Mi for coming out with a product that I belatedly realized needed in my life. And you can't beat that size and price. Definitely repurchase it. "
224228728, On AHA-BHA-PHA Real Cica 92% Cool Calming Soothing Gel ,Ely,25-35,25-35," I easily breakout and this keeps my breakouts at bay. I use this as a serum. It’s so lightweight, it not enough to be a moisturizer and if you use this too much, this could potentially dry out your face (which could lead to more breakouts) so make sure you have maybe a moisturizing toner or essence to help balance it out. ( I did that, for the ginger essence water and it has balanced everything. I looking flawless like Beyoncé y’all). So for you oil/combo acne prone ppl, use this. You can use on ur body too not just ur face. I hear it’s good for sunburns (I got lots of melanin tho and have been shut in due to covid so I wouldn’t know. But maybe this summer?) "
142491278, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence ,Kathleen H.,Dry,35-44," I truly don't know why I love this stuff, I don't notice much of a difference in my skin but I use it anyway. Its supposed to be calming, I don't notice calmer skin, I have Rosacea and not much helps but this feels nice, and hasn't caused any disruption to my skin. "
142491278, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence ,Anh N.,Normal,35-44, My skin loves all the ingredients in this bottle. It's hydrating and calming. Feels great on my skin. Missha essences never fails. 
142491278, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence ,Ruth L.,45-55,45-55, I gave this to my mother as a gift without trying it myself. My mother loved it so much that she got my sister and I to use it.  
142491278, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence ,Jimima C.,Dry,35-44,This treatment toner soothes and preps the skin for other products in my skincare routine so well that it is essential. 
142491278, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence ,Shaina,Sensitive,18-24," Soothes irritated, itchy skin "
19626747, On Fermentation Essence ,Tristan,Combination,18-24," This lovely thing is wonderful. Lightly viscous, and cool to the touch. This essence servers as a wonderful skin soother in my routine. This has not broken me out, and has caused no irritation for my skin. I would recommend for someone with acne-prone or sensitive skin! "
19626747, On Fermentation Essence ,Rebecca R.,Combination,18-24,**I’m posting for the second time as I could not find my original review** 
19626747, On Fermentation Essence ,Andrea,Combination,25-35," This lovely thing is wonderful. Lightly viscous, and cool to the touch. This essence servers as a wonderful skin soother in my routine. This has not broken me out, and has caused no irritation for my skin. I would recommend for someone with acne-prone or sensitive skin! "
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Nicole D.,Normal,55+, This essence is super hydrating and it leaves my skin feeling plump and soft. At nighttime I like to layer it 3x. I also keep the bottle in my skincare fridge so when I splash it on my face and neck it feels amazing. I have normal skin so this works perfect for me. 
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Lisa,Dry,35-44," I got interested in this after Kelly Driscoll mentioned it -- I swear by galactomyces in my routine because it really helps with my pore size and skin brightness. I've been using this, functionally, as a first treatment essence (think Missha, SK-II etc). It's a bit heavy for that, frankly, but layers beautifully. I appreciate that it adds other ferments, niacinamide and sea buckthorn extract, too, because this makes it a go-to on days when I'm feeling a shorter routine. "
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Camille,Sensitive,25-35, Hydrate et prépare bien ma peau à mes sérums 
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Anh V.,Combination,45-55, I usually skip the toner when I double cleanse and go straight to this essence. It is very hydrating and does not leave a sticky residue that interferes with your serums or creams. 
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,El.,Combination,25-35," I was hesitant to purchase this as it is a bit pricey for me, but there is a lot of product in the bottle! My skin breaks out easily and is on the dryer side. This was very moisturizing and smoothing and didn't leave a sticky film! I typically don't like the way toners feel but this one is amazing! I definitely felt like this made my skin more smooth and healthy. Once the bottle was gone I noticed that my skin wasn't as bright. Worth repurchasing! "
236163627, On Mugwort Mask ,Alyssa,Sensitive,No," Wow, for the longest time, I've been eyeing this mask. I received a sample and was compelled to buy the full-size product. I am pleased with the result, just as I was with the sample! It is truly calming. When washing off, there is this slip it creates when it makes contact with water. Hydrating, calming, and great for sensitive skin! "
236163627, On Mugwort Mask ,Monica,No,25-35, I love the cooling effect on my skin and it definitely calms my skin down and makes it softer. 
236163627, On Mugwort Mask ,Ingrid,25-35,Combination," Great results, does exactly what it says it will do. I don't use it nearly as often as recommended, though, because of two reasons. One is the large pieces of crushed plants in the mask are very sensory unfriendly (I'm autistic), but it's bearable if you're careful when rinsing to not get it in your eyes or nose. The other is that it smells awful, I joke when I use it that it's my ""pond mud"" mask because that's exactly what it smells like to me, a pond or swamp. But again, I'll repurchase this when I run out, because it really does give good results for my sensitive, dry skin. "
236163627, On Mugwort Mask ,Bridget,Sensitive,No," Pop this mask in the fridge! The cooling effect of the gel is a lifesaver for sensitive skin. I love to put this on whenever I’ve been out in the sun for too long, or if my skin is just generally irritable and stressed. It leaves you feeling de-puffed and glowing. I enjoy the herbal smell, but it is strong and may not be for everyone. The mask also has flecks of organic matter which are a bit difficult to rinse off with just water-a gentle wipe with a washcloth will help! "
236163627, On Mugwort Mask ,Solveig,No,25-35," I love the cooling effect of this mask. Especially because I keep it in the fridge it’s very cool and helps give it a calming effect. I like the way my skin feels afterward. I do not feel dried out or “stripped.” I will say I am not fond of the smell, but I think the mask itself is great so I am not deterred. "
226028611, On Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil ,Caitlin M.,Sensitive,25-35," It's gentle on my sensitive skin and removes all my makeup. I love that it doesn't have fragrance. It has a slightly thicker consistency than other cleansing oils I've tried, but this doesn't affect efficacy. Overall an excellent first step in my cleansing routine! "
226028611, On Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil ,Alexandra,Oily,18-24, I am devastated that this is sold out because it is so good!! It WIPES away my makeup like no other product has done before. Definitely give it a chance! 
226028611, On Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil ,Alexa,Oily,18-24, This product is amazing as part of a double cleansing routine! I used to have to use makeup remover for the more stubborn parts of my makeup like mascara and this breaks down even that! I follow it up with a water based cleanser to make sure everything is washed off and it is perfect. Definitely recommend!! 
226028611, On Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil ,Christine C.,Dry,45-55, This is my go to cleansing oil. It’s so easy to use. Washes off all my makeup in one go. Even waterproof mascara and I use it to easily remove hair dye stains. Everyone I recommend it to becomes a fan. 
226028611, On Gentle Black Fresh Cleansing Oil ,Ava,Sensitive,18-24, It was a good basic oil cleanser. It didn't remove much of my makeup but it was a gentle clean. 
190456602, On Deep Green Tea Serum ,Vanessa L.,Combination,18-24, Cleared my skin within a few uses. 
190456602, On Deep Green Tea Serum ,Leonor,Dry,18-24," I cant really say ive seen any change it kinda reminds me of innisfree green tea serum. has that cooling effect, for the price I say it does what it do "
190456602, On Deep Green Tea Serum ,Christina,Combination,35-44," I really wanted to LOVE this product, but I don't. However, I do really LIKE it. I tried it for the green tea benefits and the hydraulic acid ingredients, but I did not notice a significant difference in my skin. The serum goes on smooth, and is nice and light. It smells nice, and feels nice. However, it did not improve my skin condition, and it stayed the same. "
190456602, On Deep Green Tea Serum ,Jasmine C.,Combination,25-35, I had been looking for a product to help reduce acne and scars and I’m happy to say I’ve found it! In just a week my skin had cleared up a ton and it is great at fighting new breakouts. 
190456602, On Deep Green Tea Serum ,Abigail L.,Combination,18-24, Green tea was recommended to me as an anti-acne ingredient and I began to search for skincare with it. This serum did not disappoint. Although it absorbs quickly it does not leave a residue. I apply it in the morning and it helps control my oil. The only thing is I didn’t like was the packaging since the push mechanism inside makes it harder to recycle. 
91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,C R.,Dry,35-44," It absorbs well into my face and makes my skin very soft, but I don't know if I can get over the RANCID smell of it. I would say it smells like burning oil, but that's not quite right... more like some kind of mix of burning plastic and burning trash. I will not order again and am sad other oils were out of stock when I placed this order. :( "
91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,Emmy B.,Dry,<18,Thanks for your feedback!  
236159138, On Ginseng Eye Cream ,Chelsea J.,Dry,25-35," I use this at night since it’s a thicker, creamy consistency, and it’s works really great! I wake up to my eyes looking hydrated and less tired. It’s also helped minimize the appearance of my dark circles. "
236159138, On Ginseng Eye Cream ,Lackhana S.,Sensitive,35-44, Will be a staple in my winter skincare routine. I have dry sensitive skin and this eye cream is perfect for the cold winter months or dry weather climate. The texture is absolutely luxurious!!! 
236159138, On Ginseng Eye Cream ,Kay,Oily,25-35, My tired eyes always feel good after using it. The amount you get is quite large. I've never gotten so much eye cream in 1 jar before. No milia or irritation but my eyes aren't very sensitive. This eyecream is good for day and night 
236159138, On Ginseng Eye Cream ,Niharika,Combination,18-24, This eye cream is very rich and nourishing so a little goes a long way to give your eyes some TLC 
236159138, On Ginseng Eye Cream ,Amanda,Combination,25-35," The Ginseng Eye Cream is a heavy, thick moisturizer for eyes. I have seen improvements in my undereye circles. My preexisting smile lines/wrinkles have stayed the same and not decreased. Since it is thick cream, the Milia spots under my eyes have worsened, which caused me to score it lower. I am combating them with a retinol spot treatment. Still using the cream because the spot treatment has been workiing m "
237466612, On We Come in Peace Microbiome Serum ,Tatiana P.,Sensitive,18-24, If I can say one thing about this is that you need this product in your skincare routine. Probiotics I think yes! My skin eats this up and for good reason. I was going through some awful hormonal acne and within a few days of adding this product into my routine the pimples and redness started going down. Once gone there was no dark spots or pie left either. I will forever repurchase this product. I have just seen such an improvement on my over all skin health and texture. 
237466612, On We Come in Peace Microbiome Serum ,Kalia L.,Dry,35-44, This serum is lightly scented and very gentle. I'm sensitive to smells and this doesn't bother me at all. I've only been using it after weeks but already see a difference in my skin. 
237466612, On We Come in Peace Microbiome Serum ,Rachel C.,Normal,35-44," This was recommended to me during my skin consultation with Emily. I use this in my night routine. I am so happy I tried this product. I have been looking for the perfect serum for a long time. This seems to be perfect for me in so many ways after learning about this product. I am using this because it has Bakucihol, a natural retinol alternative (I tried retinol in the past and didn't like it. My skin became irritated). This helps with strengthening the skin barrier, stimulating cell turnover, and targeting hyperpigmentation. I've also seen a difference in how hydrated my skin looks. It also plumps skin for a more youthful complexion, something I appreciate. I also have redness in my skin and this has carrot, morringa seed, and blue tansy oils to help bring relief to redness and irritation. This product has so many benefits and is everything I've been looking for and more. I would never have chosen it without the recommendation. "
237466612, On We Come in Peace Microbiome Serum ,Alex,Dry,25-35," I love this! The consistency, texture, feeling, effectiveness! Everything. I love a good serum that benefits my skin barrier and this serum is definitely worth a try for anyone who wants to improve their skin barrier and skin health! Loved this so much I just had to restock and it has been in my skincare routine rotation ever since. "
237466612, On We Come in Peace Microbiome Serum ,Lindie Z.,Combination,18-24," This serum has a great consistency and feels good at first application; however, I feel like it made me break out. I might have not given it a chance, but it definitely did not produce good results during the first few days of usage. "
216340252, On Vita Duo Day Cream ,Rita V.,Combination,35-44, This moisturizer Brightens up my skin giving me a radiate look. 
216340252, On Vita Duo Day Cream ,Cassie,Normal,25-35, This has been my daily moisturizer for the last year! It's great to put on skin right before makeup and hydrating enough to put on before bed. Creamy texture and neutral smell. I love the refill too! 
216340252, On Vita Duo Day Cream ,Hannah,Combination,45-55," I tried this when my previous moisturizer ran out and it was out of stock, but now I can't possibly go back. I use it day & night and my sensitive combination skin loves it! I also really like that the packaging has refills, it feels way less wasteful than other moisturizers I've tried. Neogen really knocked it out of the park with this one! "
301807217, On Niacinamide Brightening Mask ,Waneda O.,Combination,35-44," I really enjoyed this mask, very hydrating and a nice cooling effect since I placed in the refrigerator. I like the 5 pack as I can use at a later time when I want more hydration. "
301807217, On Niacinamide Brightening Mask ,Angela O.,Combination,45-55," After I finished using this brightening mask, my face felt very sticky. I just don't like the feeling of stickiness on my face. I think it will be more suited for very dry skin condition than mine having combination skin. "
301807217, On Niacinamide Brightening Mask ,Anum A.,Combination,25-35," Very unique mask, the texture feels different than other masks. "
301807217, On Niacinamide Brightening Mask ,Evie B.,Sensitive,25-35, I got this mask in a pack and found it to be very hydrating and brightening! I love to put my masks in the fridge for a calming effect too! 
208710421, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Moisture Cream ,KD,Dry,18-24, Love it. It is lightweight and dries quickly so perfect for daytime. I have it under make-up no issue. 
208710421, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Moisture Cream ,Maaike,Dry,25-35," This smells and feels amazing, and it's very hydrating, but I've noticed it pills under makeup. I will only use this at night now. "
208710421, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Moisture Cream ,Sarah,Dry,18-24, SOOO SOOTHIG HYDRATING GREAT FOR INFLAMMATION it’s marker d as a cream however and wish it was much thicker this is more of a gel 
208710421, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Moisture Cream ,Louise,Sensitive,35-44," My skin is really sensitive and I was looking for a nighttime moisturizer. This is more like a gel than a cream, and it has a pleasant, light smell. It absorbs pretty quickly and didn’t sting, give me any redness or irritation, or break me out. I’d say it wasn’t super moisturizing but it was still heavier than what I’d typically wear during the day. I’m in the middle of buying it again. "
208710421, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Moisture Cream ,jasmine,Normal,<18," I was very disappointed with this product as I really wanted to like it. I don't usually have sensitive skin but this product gave me a terrible reaction. This product was recommended to me from the concierge skin consultation and within seconds of applying to my face, I felt it become very itchy and super hot. Using it within the week had led my face to to a very bad breakout that took a few weeks for it to fully recover. This had been my first time going along with a proper skincare routine and led me to quit using any kind of skincare within the future. Thankfully, keeping my skincare routine to just rinsing with water allowed it to heal from this horrible first experience. "
185927545, On Vitamin C Glow Powder Cleanser ,angela s.,Combination,25-35," I travel for work weekly. I LOOVE that this product is travel friendly. In the past I’ve had trouble with liquids leaking, pumps breaking, balms melting. This product solved all those problems. With just a touch of water it turns sudsy and smooth. I recommend this to all my traveling co workers! "
185927545, On Vitamin C Glow Powder Cleanser ,lost_little_fairy,Combination,45-55, Love this item a lot. I chanced by it on a clearance shelf at TJMaxx ironically and tried it. It really did make my skin feel noticeably softer during cleansing and it's a mild formula.  
185927545, On Vitamin C Glow Powder Cleanser ,Tatiana P.,Sensitive,35-44,"**However, I feel the company missed a GREAT marketing opportunity with this product and hope this is a possibility in the future: they should sell refills in compostable bags. This is a dry product and the plastic container could be refillable. Lower the cost a bit to consumers and still make the same profit. With more climate awareness, this would have an excellent pitch next to an already excellent product. "
346836141, On Hueguard Mineral SPF ,molly s.,Light,Dry, I love this spf so much I purchased the jumbo size. The only thing I wish was that it was more hydrating it makes my skin feel very dry after about an hour. 
346836141, On Hueguard Mineral SPF ,Michelle,Light,Dry, Love that this is a clean product however it doesn’t provide that Tinted Moisturized look. Hoping in the future they will broaden their shades. 
346836141, On Hueguard Mineral SPF ,Maddy,Dry,35-44," The tint is an odd orangey yellow that doesn't work with my skin. I have fair, slightly warm-toned skin. Typically primers with a yellow tint work great to balance out redness in my skin. This doesn't do that. It leaves an orangey cast. I love that it's a clean product with good ingredients. The texture of it is slightly sticky but a little dry or chalky, just sort of odd. It doesn't feel soft, if that makes any sense. (Especially at this price point) its just not for me! "
80494471, On Wrinkle Tox Skin Clinic Mask ,Cynthia H.,Sensitive,35-44," Nice sheet mask, used in the evening and layered on the extra serum. Kind of sticky after feel, but I think sheet masks are often like that. "
80494471, On Wrinkle Tox Skin Clinic Mask ,PAMELA H.,Combination,Combination, My favorite mask so far. You can actually see the difference in your skin when you remove the mask. I love this one and will buy more. 
80494471, On Wrinkle Tox Skin Clinic Mask ,Gosia,Oily,35-44, My skin was refreshed and smooth after use. 
80494471, On Wrinkle Tox Skin Clinic Mask ,Sheesha,Sensitive,35-44, I really love this mask and keep it for days when I have a special day or night out and want that extra TLC for my skin. I have sensitive skin and it's worked very well. Love how my skin feels the next day and I think it also helps to calm it plus minimize the lines Overall will keep going back to it. 
80494471, On Wrinkle Tox Skin Clinic Mask ,Chyna,Combination,25-35, This mask makes me look like a newborn. It is MIRACULOUS. Anything by Leaders is typically a win! 
48279533, On Back To Relax Soothing Gel Mask ,Julia W.,Sensitive,25-35," I have very sensitive skin. This mask is great! I always waking up feeling soft, moisturized and replenished! Love it after a long day at the beach. "
48279533, On Back To Relax Soothing Gel Mask ,jeri,Sensitive,25-35, Wore this for 10min and washed it off. The next day I woke up with my face COVERED in whiteheads and red patches. I’m not allergic to any of the botanical ingredients so I suspect one of the chemicals in this mask is not safe for sensitive skin.

217823056, On C-Niacin Toning Ampoule ,Vbaby,Normal,25-35," So I’m almost through the bottle of this stuff. I bought this to try instead of a vitamin c serum made with ascorbic acid because I’ve had a hard time finding a good one. This serum feels nice on the skin, is fragrance-free, and is non-irritating. However, I haven’t noticed any benefits to my skin claimed. This product definitely doesn’t deliver the same results as an actual vitamin C serum, and the niacinamide in it I know is good for skin but I haven’t really noticed any effects from that either. This product is akin to putting on a water gel to my skin and that’s it. I also want to note that this product doesn’t tell you the concentration of niacinamide so I don’t think it’s very much and that may be why I haven’t seen much benefit. I’m using the bottle up so not to waste it, but I won’t repurchase. This product was disappointing. "

217823056, On C-Niacin Toning Ampoule ,Aleisha A.,Combination,25-35," A great multi-purpose serum for the mornings, saw skin visibly brighten and dark spots fade faster with consistent use "
136923254," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Watery Oil Drop ",Ivonne,Normal,25-35," In searching for hydration and glow I decided to purchase this. It really helps my skin to look plump and hydrated all day. I use it morning and night and it really gives me a glow that lasts all day, also the little wrinkles on my forehead are less visible. Definitely a great addition to my routine "
136923254," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Watery Oil Drop ",Erin,Sensitive,35-44," I bought this on a whim and have not regretted it. I have very dry, highly sensive, very reactive skin. I have reactions to so many ingredients it makes shopping for new skincare a problem, but this worked into my routine seamlessly. I haven't gotten this many compliments on my skin in years. As A woman rapidly approaching middle aged I am greatful for any simple product that can overwhealm the tide of time, even if it is short term. I will be perchasing again. "
136923254," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Watery Oil Drop ",Laila A.,Oily,18-24, I don't see much of a visual difference in the morning when I use it at night but it has conditioned my skin very nicely and my skin feels supple. I wouldn't say its a necessity but definitely a great addition. If you are scared of oil having oily skin like me don't worry it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. 
136923254," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Watery Oil Drop ",Nolan M.,Sensitive,18-24, This oil is super lightweight and it brings the color back into my complexion after I cleanse. Not greasy or sticky and leaves a slight shine which I personally like. 
136923254," On Dear, Klairs Fundamental Watery Oil Drop ",Elizabeth B.,Sensitive,18-24," Absolutely love this. Not oily, just hydrating. My skin is super unhappy right now on Acutane and this just makes it feel comfortable. "
118658609, On White Truffle First Spray Serum ,Sable60,Dry,>55," Im starting to think that by using D'ALBA PIEDMONT White Truffle First Spray along with D'ALBA White Truffle Intensive Ampoule is why my complexion is appearing ""Glass Like Skin"" Ive been using the D'ALBA White Truffle Inentsive Ampoule for over 2 years now. Im on my 2nd bottle when I noticed the D'ALBA First Spray. Together, and along with a moisturizer to top them off, has given my 61 year old a complexion comparable to when I was in my 30s. I have very few lines on my face and no wrinkles. The D'ALBA White Truffle First Spray is a dual phase formula. The top appears to be a light, drier oil and the bottom layer a creamy white serum. By shaking the bottle and mixing the two, allows the formula to spray out a fine mist to my face and neck. Dry time is minimal. There is no sticky after effect either. 5 minutes later, I apply the D'ALBA White Truffle Intesive Ampoule...Youll love using these two skin care products together. My Winter skin loves tge deep hydrating & moisturizing effect...highly recommended. "
118658609, On White Truffle First Spray Serum ,Elizabeth B.,Dry,25-35, I wanted to love this but I just didn’t. Sure it is refreshing and I have a glow for about 5 minutes but that is it. It did not hydrate my skin. Not worth it for the price.

282430220, On Licorice Trial Kit ,Ima E.,Sensitive,45-55," I was really glad I tried this as a trial set. The eye cream drys out my eyes and irritates my skin. I also found the serum drying. The toner is nice, but not so great that I would seek it out in a full size. "
282430220, On Licorice Trial Kit ,DAR,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
282430220, On Licorice Trial Kit ,Brenna,Oily,18-24," I received this trial as a part of the lunar new year promotion and I have to say, I am loving it so far. The toner is so so refreshing. The serum is easy for my skin to absorb (my skin often has a hard time absorbing product which then leads to a goopy feeling on my face). I paired these products with the hanskin calming toner and wowwwwww my skin has been so soft and nourished I feel so great. I will definitely buy the full products of these. "
222559684, On LHA Blemish Ampoule ,Laurie D.,Combination,35-44, Literally applied this before bed on a hormonal acne spot - and the NEXT morning it was nearly gone! 
222559684, On LHA Blemish Ampoule ,Megan M.,Combination,18-24, I have used this product for about six months and love it. It helps heal any acne blemishes in a way that is less harsh and is less prone to dry out my face. My skin just feels healthier since using this in my skincare routine. 
222559684, On LHA Blemish Ampoule ,Eva P.,Normal,35-44," I love this. I was skeptical especially since it is only $15 but oh my god, this works. It helps so much with clearing acne (I mainly get whiteheads and cystic) and I will definitely buy again when I run out of my current one. The only downside is the bottle is a bit small. "
216463097, On Moisture Boost Gel To Water Morning Cleanser ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," I had a really strange experience with this cleanser. It produced absolutely no foam, so I was just rubbing cold gel onto my skin. Trying to rinse it off was also a strange experience. Ended up giving this away after trying it once. "

216463097, On Moisture Boost Gel To Water Morning Cleanser ,DR,Normal,<18, This cleanser is good for the dry fall and winter season since it's not too stripping. However during the summer months it's a bit too gentle for my oily skin. The consistency is a bit too watery so it can leak out a bit when it's upright or when opening the container it comes out even without squeezing 
179171356, On Green Pearlsation PHA Calming Toner ,jsdabon22,Combination,18-24," i loved this bottle of goodness. It was the extra step i needed to help with my acne and i couldnt be happier. I wish it was in stock. I used it till the very end, not a single complaint. "
179171356, On Green Pearlsation PHA Calming Toner ,Girley,Oily,35-44, The toner is gentle to my skin. I used this to reduced Rosacea and it brilliantly work. I'm happy. 
179171356, On Green Pearlsation PHA Calming Toner ,Andrew L.,Normal,18-24, I use this twice daily to help with acne and it lights bumps and texture within my skin 
179171356, On Green Pearlsation PHA Calming Toner ,nefre21@gmail.com,Oily,25-35, I love everything about this toner. It is so gentle on my skin and works better than the 30 days miracle toner. it has reduce my redness and my breakouts are better. This for me has become a holy grail. Ladies if you have acne prone oily skin like me give this a try!!!!!! 
179171356, On Green Pearlsation PHA Calming Toner ,Amrutha D.,Oily,25-35, Really helped refine my skin texture and decrease the end of the day greasiness I usually experience. Love it! 
49211907, On Squeeze Green Watery Gel Cream ,Amber,Combination,25-35, I never thought I could find a moisturizer that beat my favorite Neutrogena hydrogel but I was wrong. This is the perfect gel moisturizer that is light but hydrating! 
49211907, On Squeeze Green Watery Gel Cream ,Olivia,Combination,18-24," Awesome moisturizer! Makes your skin feel hydrated, like it just drank a glass of water. Nice and light but still does a great job moisturizing, unlike some other ""light"" moisturizer that leaves your skin dry and flaky. Really love how this sits after applied. Never had an issue with it breaking me out at all, my skin loves this! No irritation at all, kind of a cooling nice soothing feeling. "
49211907, On Squeeze Green Watery Gel Cream ,Sam D.,Combination,18-24, Excellent for oily skin. 
49211907, On Squeeze Green Watery Gel Cream ,ann,Combination,18-24, Goes on and absorbs pretty nicely. Super light and hydrating 
238750716, On Baggage Claim Eye Masks - Gold ,Rose,Dry,18-24, A little disappointed the mask wasn’t gold on both sides but was one of the most hydrating eye masks I’ve used so far. A definite must-buy when it gets restocked! 
238750716, On Baggage Claim Eye Masks - Gold ,Sierra H.,Combination,18-24," I really enjoy products that deliver beneficial ingredients and results as well as have an experiential appeal. These eye masks really tick off all those boxes. I noticed a pretty big transformation the first time I used them on puffy /swollen morning eyes and now sometimes go over top of them with a cold spoon to double up the goodness. Honestly, they also just make me feel extra fancy which I believe is good for the spirit too :) "

142491252, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence [Mist Type] ,Jessica H.,Combination,25-35, I like that it is a must and feels great on my skin! 
142491252, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence [Mist Type] ,Shannz,Sensitive,35-44, I have tried many things for hypersensitive skin and this has been my holy grail essence ! Absolutely must have. 
142491252, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence [Mist Type] ,Jacqueline,Dry,25-35, I love face mists for my lazy days or when I want a light layer to incorporate into my routine. It’s great to spray in between steps and I love that it’s fermented mugwort. It’s pricey for what you get so I would suggest waiting for sales 
142491252, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence [Mist Type] ,Ash M.,Sensitive,35-44, I got this because I'm a huge fan of Missha and also of the specific ingredients in this product. For the price point I was expecting more. It just doesn't live up to the hype IMO. I really wanted to love it but I think the first treatment essence mist which Soko stopped carrying (bring back the mist!) was a much better product for the cost. 
142491252, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence [Mist Type] ,Monika,Combination,25-35,I will say the product does feel nice and refreshing....but I really did not notice any difference in my skin with the product. I did not feel like it added any extra moisture or helped tremendously in anyway. It also has a bit of an odd smell. It does dissipate after awhile but until it does everything is just a bit off smell wise around you.  
140973455, On Dual Moist Toning Lotion ,J J.,Normal,18-24," Like the light consistency (slightly thicker than water) and faint scent (very fresh). I can't tell if it made any difference to my skin, although I've been using it for about 1.5 weeks so maybe it needs more time. I wish it was more hydrating. I will most likely repurchase because I like hybrid products "
140973455, On Dual Moist Toning Lotion ,Anna,Dry,35-44, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
140973455, On Dual Moist Toning Lotion ,Martin S.,Sensitive,55+," I pump this on my palm and then press it gently on my face. It is about the consistency of water but feels much more hydrating on my skin, especially when sealed in with moisturizer. I like it enough that I've already bought a second bottle. "
140973455, On Dual Moist Toning Lotion ,Kanykei,Dry,18-24," Moist Toning Lotion is a true savior for my sensitive, reactive and often inflamed skin. It calmed and moisturized my skin without leaving any residue. Its pleasure to use before moisturizer and I am very happy with results. "
217822985, On C-Niacin Toning Cream ,Winni Z.,Combination,18-24, I've been using this product for ~2 months now. Not really sure how effective this product is. The cream is very lightweight/watery. 
217822985, On C-Niacin Toning Cream ,Jeradlene R.,Combination,25-35, I really wanted to like this item but it gave me rough patches and made my skin dry :( 
217822985, On C-Niacin Toning Cream ,Bonnie G.,Sensitive,25-35,We're so sorry to hear that this product didn't work out for you! Please reach out to our team at 
185927459, On Vitamin C Glow Mask ,Sheri,Dry,45-55, I am a mask junkie so always looking to try new products. Some clay masks can be pretty drying so wasn't sure how this one would work out. I was pleasantly surprised that it is a cream mask with little soft microbeads (filled with good stuff!). It goes on smoothly and doesn't dry out (no crackles!). I feel it does brighten my complexion and leaves it feeling smooth and soft. No irritation at all and no breakouts. I rotate this in at least once/week with my other masks to give me the Vit. C boost my skin needs. A little goes a long way so the product size is generous and will last a while. 
185927459, On Vitamin C Glow Mask ,Alyssa C.,Sensitive,25-35," I like vitamin c, but my skin is pretty sensitive and I tend to overuse it when I have a vitamin c serum. I like this because I can use it once or twice a week, and it feels like a fun indulgence. I’m trying to do more wash off masks in general because it’s better for the environment than sheet masks, and this was a pretty unique wash off mask. It doesn’t dry my face at all, which is good since I have dry skin to begin with. My skin tone looks brighter and more even after I use it. "
185927459, On Vitamin C Glow Mask ,Leslie B.,Combination,35-44," I bought this to go along with some recommendations from my skin concierge. I wanted the free gift promotion and figured I’d add a mask. At first I wasn’t sure, it doesn’t really feel like a mask let alone a typical clay mask and I wasn’t really seeing any difference. But after using it 1/2 times a week over the last 3 weeks, tonight after washing it off I could finally see a difference. My face looked brighter, my scars and pigmentation looked a hair lighter, my complexion more even. I will continue using it as part of my nighttime routine a couple times a week until I’ve finished it before I decide on repurchasing. I have combo skin more dry in the winter, it does make my skin feel a little tight after use but I follow with my full routine and have no problems with dryness. "
185927459, On Vitamin C Glow Mask ,EmmyElla,Combination,25-35, I purchased this mask to help treat some pimples around my mouth/chin area. It didn't seem to do anything for the acne but diminish the scaring a bit that usually happens to my skin when I get pimples of any size. I was hoping it would dry out the pimples and help speed up the process but I saw no difference. 
185927459, On Vitamin C Glow Mask ,Arya,Sensitive,25-35," Most clay masks have been making my skin sting and burn lately, but this one didn't! It goes on like a cream and washes off easily. My skin was bright and soft afterwards, and it helped to fade some dark spots caused by acne scars. I will definitely repurchase! "
248635316, On 1025 Dokdo Toner ,N'Lissa Y.,Oily,25-35, I’ve been using this toner for about a week and I like the how fresh my face feels after using it. It doesn’t leave me too dry or tight. 
248635316, On 1025 Dokdo Toner ,Aila T.,Combination,18-24," I have found my new holy grail for dehydrated sensitive skin! I used to use the I'm From Rice Toner but I was on the market for smth cheaper, and I'm so happy I found this! Like the description, it's not sticky at all and your skin will feel significantly smoother after a few uses without stripping the natural moisture on your skin. It's a good balance b/w hydrating and also gentle daily exfoliation! Never made my skin feel raw or irritated! ALSO! You get more bang for your buck bc of how much you get in one bottle! Worth the try if you're looking for a new all-season toner :) No wonder this product has so much hype in Korea. Soko glam pls never take this out of your inventory !! "
248635316, On 1025 Dokdo Toner ,Haley F.,Combination,18-24," Hydrating and slightly exfoliating, this is a good all around toner "
248635316, On 1025 Dokdo Toner ,Christine,Sensitive,<18, I actually bought this a couple of months ago for my teenage daughter. She has dry acne prone skin during the winter. This is great as a moisturizing toner or a skin friendly toner that gently exfoliates the skin. I love the ingredients such sugarcane extract which is an exfoliating ingredient that can smooth and brighten skin’s appearance. Sea water which is rich in minerals to help heal and protect the skin barrier. Panthenol which improves skin hydration and reduces inflammation. My daughter says that it has helped her maintain skin balance and leaves her skin feeling refreshed without any sticky feel. 
248635316, On 1025 Dokdo Toner ,Elizabeth M.,Normal,25-35," I switched from the 30 Day Miracle Toner to this, just to try. My skin is super clear, more moisturized (great for winter), and all-around more glow-y. I can see why this toner got as much hype as it did, it's fantastic. "
114407036, On Multi Solution Triple V Ampoule ,Gosia,Oily,35-44," Results are amazing, my skin glows after each use! One bottle lasts for a long time. "
114407036, On Multi Solution Triple V Ampoule ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," I saw results after two weeks of consistent use, it helped fade my hyperpigmentation in combination with my other products. It’s very light feeling, not sticky, and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I’ve tried other vitamin c serums but have yet to find one that I like as much as this one "
114407036, On Multi Solution Triple V Ampoule ,Brigitte,Combination,35-44, Good product 
114407036, On Multi Solution Triple V Ampoule ,Emma,Combination,25-35," Really liked this, reduced redness and acne scars "
114407036, On Multi Solution Triple V Ampoule ,McKinley,Sensitive,18-24, I received this with the brightening set and it turned my face bright red for hours after using. Wouldn’t recommend if you have sensitive skin. 
158243733, On Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub ,kev,Combination,18-24, I liked the compact size but at the same time wish it was a little bigger. I think it does a great job doing a gentle cleaning of the dead skin on lips. Although wish the product had more in it because it can be pricy for $12. 
158243733, On Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub ,Michele R.,Combination,25-35, This is my first chemical lip scrub (I've used a physical one before). It's so oddly satisfying to see the dead skin shed off! It's a great addition to my lip care routine; I've always been a lip balm addict and now I'm happy to prep with this bubbly scrub! 
158243733, On Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub ,Adeola A.,Combination,25-35, Refreshed. Cleasing lips 
158243733, On Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub ,Claudia A.,Dry,25-35, I know others are saying this did nothing but to be honest im not sure if they’ve used the product properly. This removed 70% of the dry skin on my lips and was awesome. 
158243733, On Bubi Bubi Bubble Lip Scrub ,Lisa W.,Dry,35-44," I read so many awesome reviews about this scrub, but I feel like it’s just mediocre. I don’t feel it exfoliates at all, but I do like how it bubbles! "
236163266, On Rice Serum ,Victoria D.,Combination,25-35, I have been using this Serum for about a week now and I love it. It makes my skin super smooth and bright. 
236163266, On Rice Serum ,charlene w.,Combination,35-44,I highly recommend this serum 
236163266, On Rice Serum ,Pamela V.,Combination,25-35, I love the texture of it and I am still currently using it! 
236163266, On Rice Serum ,Nina,Combination,25-35," I love this serum, my face looks 100% lighter all my dark spots are fading. Buy it!! I highly recommend it!! "
236163266, On Rice Serum ,Monii H.,Combination,18-24," This serum is moisturizing without leaving your skin feeling or looking greasy. A little goes a long way, and I felt like my skin looked more ""plump"" if that makes sense! :) Due to the packaging you have to work a bit to get the last portion of the serum out, but the product itself worked great for my sensitive skin. "
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Paige,Combination,35-44," I did not look at the photo of the mask above, and was very surprised by the herbs-in-goo consistency when I first opened it. (That was my bad, so no points docked there... Just suggesting that you check the pic yourself!) It's kinda messy to apply and it kinda feels like it's going to slide off my face. Also: when I washed it off I always get nervous that all the leafy bits are going to clog my sink.  "
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Elisabeth R.,Combination,18-24,"Ignoring all that, I still just don't love the product. Perhaps my skin type (combination, a little acne prone, minor redness, not very sensitive) isn't the target market and that's why I didn't see or feel any difference. I'll use up this mask because it doesn't negatively effect my skin, but I won't be repurchasing either. "
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Sozo,Oily,35-44," I would highly recommend this product. It has a nice tea/herbal smell to it and is not offensive at all. There is no added fragrance, the smell comes straight from the herbs within the mask. I have sensitive, somewhat oily skin and this product is very soothing and calming and definitely helps with redness. It leaves my face feeling smooth, calm and happy. I have used it several times and still have a lot left, so it is definitely worth the price. If you have concerns with sensitivity and redness, I highly recommend this product. I will say though, application and washing off can be quite messy due to the watery and herbal nature of this mask. "
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Cristina R.,Combination,18-24," Smells and feels great. It’s a bit messier than I expected — it’s really just bits of leaf in gel. It doesn’t dry or stiffen such as other masks I’ve used. It remains wet until I wash it off. So, I’m not sure how much it’s really pulling out of my skin, or how much exfoliating or purifying it does. However, my skin looks nice and feels nice and soft post-rinse, and following it up with toner/essence/vitamin c is producing a nice, even result and my pores and rosacea seem reduced. Overall, it doesn’t HURT my skin, and anything that doesn’t make me break out is a win. However, but I’m not sure if it’s really scrubbed, purified, or improved it the way I would expect a mask to. "
140973444, On Spot Saver Mugwort Ampoule ,Eleanora S.,Combination,25-35," The first time I used this I saw it was effective in helping stop breakouts. Now, I break out less, but this doesn't do anything for me. "
140973444, On Spot Saver Mugwort Ampoule ,Rita V.,Combination,35-44, My skin feels and looks amazing ! 
140973444, On Spot Saver Mugwort Ampoule ,Kalli K.,Combination,25-35," I don’t use this daily, but have been rotating it into my routine every few days… I have splotchy redness and active chin breakouts. I use this ampoule at night, layering over real firming bakuchiol serum on my whole face. When I wake up my skin is less red and active acne spots are reduced. I can’t say whether it’s this product, or the combo of products, but I’m happy to keep using it. "
140973444, On Spot Saver Mugwort Ampoule ,Kate,Normal,18-24," It certainly made one of my stubborn pimples go away in roughly one week, but after trying to use it to calm my redness a bunch of other papule pimples showed up? I’m not sure if I’m purging or if this is what caused them but… idk. It works? But also maybe it really Really doesn’t? Do with that what you will "
179173975, On Probiotics Relief Cream ,Stephanie,Combination,25-35," I enjoyed this product, it was lightweight, had a cooling, refreshing feel to it and great for the summer. It unfortunately doesn’t do enough for the dryer months but I will definitely want to revisit this product come June. "
179173975, On Probiotics Relief Cream ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," I used the whole jar, but I didn’t enjoy it personally. I really wanted to like this one but it’s just too sticky for my taste, made it feel heavy and wouldn’t let me forget it was there all day. It definitely sounds like it does great things so I feel like I’m missing out, plus it never bothered my sensitive skin or left it dry. Just not for me, but I’m sure someone else’s skin may love it! What’s heavy feeling for me may be the amount of moisture someone else’s dry skin needs "
179173975, On Probiotics Relief Cream ,Jayme B.,Normal,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
188810475, On Green Tangerine Vita C Serum Mask ,Lisa,Dry,35-44," I picked this up on a whim, because why not -- their serum from the same line has been getting a lot of play. This had the immediate hydrating effects you'd expect from a sheet mask, and did have some glow to it, though it's quite temporary. The mask fit well, though it was surprisingly hard to unfold "
188810475, On Green Tangerine Vita C Serum Mask ,KSF,Oily,35-44, I was very surprised by this mask. There is a lot of essence in the package. Mask is soft and fit my face very well. Skin was super hydrated and glowing after use. I will definitely repurchase and use for those days when I have a special event or when I want an extra hydration boost. 
188810475, On Green Tangerine Vita C Serum Mask ,Ally,Combination,25-35," I always pick up a new sheet mask with every order as a fun way to try new ones and honestly I wasn't expecting to love this. I wish it didn't contain the essential oils, but despite that, it really left the most healthy and glowy skin. I followed up with my moisturizer and my skin looked so healthy and radiance I didn't want makeup at all. I popped mine in the fridge for a half hour before using - highly recommend! "
188810475, On Green Tangerine Vita C Serum Mask ,archana,Normal,35-44, This is one of my favorite sheet mask. My skin gets a glow that stays all day after I use this product. 
188810475, On Green Tangerine Vita C Serum Mask ,Leonor,Dry,18-24," I love this serum.. it does everything that I want to do. The texture makes it amazing.. some vitamin c has an oily feeling but with this, it's not like that. Runs out fast though "
428420734, On The Vitamin C 23 Serum ,Miles0716,Combination,35-44," I am so glad that this is back… It brightened up my skin and i am so happy with results. Already purchased another bottle, highly recommended! "
428420734, On The Vitamin C 23 Serum ,Jihye B.,Combination,25-35," I added this serum to my routine to see if it'll improve a few dark spots, and I started seeing results after 2 weeks of regular use! My dark spots are clearing up and blending with my face more and more everyday. "
428420734, On The Vitamin C 23 Serum ,rachel A.,Combination,25-35," I was really excited for this because I haven’t really met a Cosrx product my skin doesn’t like but every time I tried to incorporate this into my routine, it left me waking with new blemishes/spots. There are a lot better vitamin c products for cheaper "
428420734, On The Vitamin C 23 Serum ,Liz,Dry,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
161994554, On Calming Clean Water ,Sharon B.,Sensitive,45-55," I started using this as my morning cleanser and just love the way it leaves my skin so smooth. It seems really gentle and non-drying, too. "
161994554, On Calming Clean Water ,AD,Combination,25-35, This is a must have! Repurchased as soon as I ran out. Light and calming but effective. Leaves you feeling clean but not tight and stripped. Love the light scent as well. I will continue to repurchase. 
161994554, On Calming Clean Water ,krys,Oily,25-35, I use this as my morning or in-between cleanser and I love it. There's also a nice calming effect if I go in for blackhead treatment and need something to sooth the swelling/redness. Very nice and easy to use product! 
161994554, On Calming Clean Water ,Elisabeth R.,Combination,35-44," It smells so good, and my skin feels soft and clean. I wish it came in a giant shower gel form! "
161994554, On Calming Clean Water ,Amber B.,Combination,35-44," I use this every day. I love it. It does a good job at getting my face clean, but I don't wear a whole lot of makeup. "
23406363, On Moisturizing Recovery Mask ,Minyuan H.,Combination,35-44, I love all Leaders sheet masks and this one did not disappoint. Your skin will thank you after one use; highly recommend!!! 
23406363, On Moisturizing Recovery Mask ,Alex F.,Dry,18-24," I love sheet masks and have purchased many throughout the years, this one however isn't quite doing it. It's a little bit of a hassle to untangle the mask from the protective layers its encased in (not to mention wasteful). I'm confused why the mask is encased in so many layers because I didn't find it particularly hydrating at all. The mask didn't fit well, and actually stung my face and I'm usually not irritated by anything. There's so many other great sheet masks on this website, I'd recommend you purchase another instead. "
23406363, On Moisturizing Recovery Mask ,Kimberly R.,Dry,25-35, Work well 
23406363, On Moisturizing Recovery Mask ,tracey m.,Dry,45-55, I have dry sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it while moisturizing. 
23406363, On Moisturizing Recovery Mask ,Noémie L.,Combination,18-24," The mask was very soothing and refreshing but unlike most, it really didn't fit well over my face. The mask was too big for my face and i had trouble keeping it on especially in the nose area "
179208190, On Pore Clarifying Toner 10% Glycolic Acid ,Jesica S.,Combination,25-35, I've been trying to find a new toner for a while now that will exfoliate but not sting my sensitive skin and I've found it. I decided to try the travel size version and see if it'd co-operate with my skin and it did. I also like that this formula works well with other serums in my routine. I'm not fond of the smell but it's not completely overbearing. I'll definitely look into repurchasing a larger bottle. 
179208190, On Pore Clarifying Toner 10% Glycolic Acid ,Janelle,Oily,18-24, I have oily skin. I got this in a set. It felt like it was burning my skin when I put it on. Genuinely horrible. Maybe this just isn’t for oily types? I still love SokoGlam. 
179208190, On Pore Clarifying Toner 10% Glycolic Acid ,Jill,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Briar,Dry,25-35," I’m almost finished with the bottle. I have dry, sensitive skin tendencies. I wash my face and then follow with this before applying a prescription retinoid or the occasional AHA at night. It’s liquid, almost a soft water like consistency. Someone mentioned the bottle being convenient and I would agree with that. The valve on top acts as a good portion control. The product itself is just okay (especially for the price). There are definitely more effective products out there. It does have soothing qualities but even that I find to just be kind of meh. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,pikapop,Dry,35-44," I have sensitive skin that gets red easily but with this stuff, it calms my skin and the itchiness disappears fast. I use it morning and night and notice it does help other products sink into my skin better. Cica is a skin saver "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Bunny,Sensitive,25-35, This product is great. I do not break out as often as I did since I started to use this product.  
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Marlena A.,Sensitive,25-35," I have to say, the design of the bottle is great. When I tip it over, not a lot comes out. Just a good amount . I tap 2-3 times and it is enough for my entire face. I like this a lot because for other products, I tap once and a lot comes out. this is totally worth it. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Luanda L.,Sensitive,25-35," I have very sensitive skin--Why? Simply because I use prescription Retin- A every night--which is amazing---but it destroys the skin barrier. So, I am using this Cica Essence and LOVING IT!!! "
289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,rachel,Combination,18-24," I got this lip balm and was incredibly surprised by how different it looked compared to the picture. I got the Lychee one and it was a much darker shade than in the photo. It was a pleasant surprise though because the Lychee one matched my natural lip color which is awesome! I don't use too much to get color, just one swipe on one of the lips and then spread the color across both lips. "
289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,Zakiah S.,Combination,18-24,Just found out that I was looking at the first photo which is the Petal shade even though the shade selected for checkout is Lychee! Glad I made the mistake 
289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,Mardi08,Dry,25-35," Not drying, good smell, good texture and pretty color. Stays on for quite a long time! "
289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,Bonnie G.,Dry,25-35," I've tried a few lip balms from nivea to laneige and they never sit comfortably on my lips. It always just creates an uncomfortable film throughout the day. But this formula thoughhhh *chefs kiss*. Never feels heavy even if you apply too much. Smells freaking delicious. And I finally understand what people mean when they say, they woke up with lush lips because this does that when used as an overnight lip mask! Thank you sokoglam for curating this! "
185927322, On Tea Tree Serum ,Anyi,Combination,18-24," The serum was calming, little to no scent, very watery gel like texture, the plump is a little loose. I use it to calm freshly squeezed pimples or to smooth the maskne area. "
185927322, On Tea Tree Serum ,Megan,Dry,25-35," I've had extremely acne prone skin for longer than I can remember and I've tried so many different products without any results so for me discovering Soko Glam was an absolute game changer! My skin is in the best condition it's ever been but unfortunately having to wear a mask every time I go out means I'm still fighting breakouts. Being a massage therapist, I have to move around a lot a work, which means sometimes I get a little sweaty under my mask so by the time I get home my skin tends to be very red and inflamed. Now whenever I get a bad flare up, I know exactly what to grab! This serum has been amazing for reducing my inflammation and keeping my acne under control. I would 100% recommend this and I'm so happy I found this product. "
185927322, On Tea Tree Serum ,Salley F.,Oily,<18," I've used this for a few weeks and have been satisfied with the results. It is definitely hydrating (not oily or overly moisturizing though) and helps calm and cool my skin like it claims to. I haven't seen much difference with my acne, however, but it hasn't made it it worse at all. It's worth a try and quite affordable! "
185927322, On Tea Tree Serum ,C,>55,>55," I love the Tea Tree Cleansing Water having repurchased it several times and overall it’s a much better value. As many have said this is a small bottle, so I only use it when needed. This is an extra step when breakouts occur particularly during the summer. It’s nice to have but not a necessity for me. "
235840391, On My First Essener ,Dorota,Normal,No," I enjoy the texture and very subtle rose scent as well are the glass packaging. I plan on putting a tiny bouquet of dried flowers in the bottle when I'm done with this product. I enjoy the thicker texture and that my skin is left looking plump and hydrated. My only issue is that it is kind of hard to get the product out of the small hole since it is a thicker texture, but I think it's coming out a bit easier now that I have used some. "
235840391, On My First Essener ,Allison,No,18-24," I’m not sure if I’m being too harsh, but I had high hopes for this product and feel a little let down. I love mugwort, and Missha’s Artemesia First Treatment Essence is one of my favorite products because it prepares my skin beautifully for the rest of my routine. I was hoping with the added benefit of green tea, plus the thicker consistency, this would add an extra punch and would be a step up. Unfortunately, I definitely prefer the Missha mugwort product to this one, and once I run out of the Essencer I will probably not repurchase it. "
235840391, On My First Essener ,Jennifer,25-35,Sensitive,"First things first, the elephant in the room- yes, this is as difficult to get out of the bottle as everyone says. I’ve never experienced another product like it. You have to shake the bottle really hard to get one drop out, and I use 2 to 3 drops as part of my routine. It feels a little messy because I’m shaking the bottle so hard that the drops are haphazardly flying onto my hand (side note: this product is so thick you can/should apply it with your hands, not a cotton round). I love that the product is thick, I just wish there was a better way to dispense it. A dropper, maybe?  "
422221331, On Sebum Balancing Gel Moisturizer ,Lauren Y.,Combination,18-24," I got to try this moisturizer before launch and I really enjoy it. It’s great for my combination skin that leans more towards oily in the summer, it’s super lightweight and just melts into your skin super quickly. I love the packaging, the pump makes it super easy to get a regular amount and keep the product clean, and the rest of the packaging is very pretty. I also love the finish on my skin, it leans more towards matte but my skin still feels hydrated. If you want a super dewy finish from your moisturizer, you wouldn’t like this, but I appreciate the more matte finish because I feel less oily and shiny throughout the day. I do feel this helps balance my sebum and keeps my skin from over producing. Overall, a fantastic moisturizer, especially for people with more oily skin "
422221331, On Sebum Balancing Gel Moisturizer ,Olivia,Sensitive,18-24, There must be some magic in this bottle because my skin improved overnight after first use. I have sensitive skin and I have redness area around and under my cheeks which I couldn't figure out how to minimize. This gel moisturizer is the solution to one of my long-term skin concerns.  
422221331, On Sebum Balancing Gel Moisturizer ,Avery L.,Normal,25-35,"It feels amazing on the skin. It's lightweight but moisturizing enough to use it for my night routine. On top of that, no fragrance! We love that for her. I'm gonna have to stock up on this moisturizer because, seriously, my skin never looked this good. "
422221331, On Sebum Balancing Gel Moisturizer ,Amber L.,Oily,<18," I've been using this moisturizer for about a week. I love how lightweight it feels. I'm definitely planning on adding this to my weekly routine, if not daily! It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, without being too heavy. It's great for daytime moisturizing. "
289127242, On Vitamin C Complex Serum ,Zack,Combination,25-35, Another hit from Naturium. This is a great serum. 
289127242, On Vitamin C Complex Serum ,Dev C.,Combination,25-35, My skin glows after using this! This is my new daily serum 
289127242, On Vitamin C Complex Serum ,Rachel F.,Dry,25-35, Beautiful vitamin C which helps to brighten my skin and work with my spf against free radicals. I have been wanting to the Naturium since I started seeing this on various YouTube videos and I am so happy that it’s available on Soko Glam as they ship to the UK. I love that the products are fragrance free. The packing is wonderful as I like the pumps. The package arrived in good time.  
289127242, On Vitamin C Complex Serum ,Caressa S.,Combination,25-35,Naturium is now available in the UK through Space NK but will still be using Soko Glam due to not all products have been released to the UK yet 
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,Melissa,Combination,25-35," I wanted to love this, but it's just ok. It has a medicinal, herbal smell that some people might not care for, but I like it. It just did not provide the amount of hydration and protection I need. This is probably better for people in more humid climates. I will use it but won't repurchase. "
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,Monica,Combination,55+, I love this hand cream. I have very dry hands and nothing short of a heavy cream will keep my hands soft and moisturized. I also wash a lot so I need a good cream that doesn't have a lot of perfumes. This cream is light but very hydrating. Leaves my skin really soft and has a natural light smell that doesn't overwhelm me or my dog. I love it! Will be buying more! 
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,Safia,Normal,45-55, Good cream. Moisturizes well. Leaves my hands soft. I like how it’s in a tube dispenser for hygiene. Smells good too! 
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,Safia M.,Dry,45-55, Nice thick cream to relieve the winter dryness. I also like that it fits in my purse or work jacket easily. 
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,C,Sensitive,55+," Light herbal scent, nice consistency and dies a decent job of moisturizing my hands. This is a smaller tube that easily fits in a purse. "
179208191, On Rice Pure Clay Mask to Foam Cleanser ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," Absolutely love the versatility of this mask. Depending on my skin, I'll leave it on as a mask or just use it as a face wash. Love the clay to foam effect. Not drying, but still deep cleans. "
179208191, On Rice Pure Clay Mask to Foam Cleanser ,Maria,Sensitive,18-24," I used the entire bottle before giving a review, and I can honestly say that I can't live without this. Coming from somone with skin too sensitive for cerave, cetaphil and roche posay, this was perfect! My skin is glowing, no breakouts, and I can't wait to buy again! "
179208191, On Rice Pure Clay Mask to Foam Cleanser ,Lacey,Combination,25-35," I’ve only used this for a few days but my enlarged pores around my nose look so much better now! Not to mention the few blemishes I have are starting to get smaller too. When I used the cleanser last night in the shower, I smeared it all over my face and then left it on for 2 minutes and rinsed with a cloth. When I say my skin has never been so soft using only ONE product, I mean it. I hadn’t even put my night cream on yet and I just couldn’t get over how soft and glowy my skin was. And it didn’t make my skin feel tight and pinched like other clay masks do. Forever keeping this in my arsenal! "
179208191, On Rice Pure Clay Mask to Foam Cleanser ,Ginger,Oily,25-35, This is the best cleanser ever! I’ve been slowly switching to more rice based products and I noticed a complete difference. I’m waiting for this is come back in stock so I can order more than one to have on hand. I have oily sensitive skin and this was not harsh in any way and didn’t strip away the oils completely. 
179208191, On Rice Pure Clay Mask to Foam Cleanser ,Ginger,Oily,25-35, Great cleanser that doesn't strip away the oils from face. I have oily acne prone sensitive skin and this is great! It calms my skin. 
231501196, On The Sustainable Cleansing Pad Set ,Yuki W.,Normal,25-35," These are okay cotton pads. Smoother than the texture you would get with disposables, if you prefer the light exfoliation. After one wash they already got a little wavy, and the tags stick out, but still function well. I used the net bag they came in to wash them as well, and about half of them escaped during wash, hahaha. So I will have to use one with a zipper. Unsure if worth the price, but I am always glad to add a reusable item to my drawer. "
231501196, On The Sustainable Cleansing Pad Set ,Karli,Combination,25-35," I wanted to find washable, reusable pads with a laundry bag that would help with the application of my AM cleanse (micellar water). It helps distribute the product and cleanse my face and stays super soft after washes. I personally wouldn't use this for toner, but feel that it helps with my mess-free cleansing. "
231501196, On The Sustainable Cleansing Pad Set ,N'Lissa Y.,Oily,25-35," I bought these on a whim because I was out of cotton pads. I don't mind them so far. I don't have sensitive skin, but I could see how these might feel a little rough for someone who does. Although, I personally like the extra exfoliation. The mesh storage and washing bag will shrink significantly if you dry it. "
231501196, On The Sustainable Cleansing Pad Set ,Elizabeth C.,Dry,25-35, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
217815160, On Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream ,Suzette C.,Sensitive,55+, I have only been using it a week but I can already see brightening under my eyes! 
217815160, On Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream ,Waneda O.,Sensitive,35-44, I discovered this brand at Nordstrom and am in love with this eye cream. A little really does go a long way. I actually keep this in the refrigerator and it feels great and very smooth during application. My eyes do not look puffy at all! 
217815160, On Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream ,Minyuan H.,Combination,35-44, I've wanted to try this for a while because it's highly rated and I'm glad I did. The eye cream is worth all the hype and goes on very smooth. My eyes do look brighter in the morning so I will definitely buy again. 
217815160, On Wide Awake Brightening Eye Cream ,Andr,Combination,25-35, Just another ordinare eyecream for me... 
257310649, On Plump-Kin Retinol Eye Cream ,Dorine C.,Sensitive,55+, I have been using this for 2 weeks. Fine lines not as noticeable & no adverse reaction (I have sensitive skin). You don't need alot so it should last for quite awhile. Would purchase again. 
257310649, On Plump-Kin Retinol Eye Cream ,Jessica M.,Combination,25-35, I love the way this eye cream feels! It’s soothing and did not cause any issues. 
257310649, On Plump-Kin Retinol Eye Cream ,Joy,Combination,55+, Amazing product it’s a must !!! 
257310649, On Plump-Kin Retinol Eye Cream ,Alexia,Sensitive,18-24, I got this eye cream as a sample and the sample has lasted me SO long. A little goes a long way and it’s genuinely one of the best eye creams I have ever used. Sometimes I don’t know if eye creams are a scam or not but this is the real deal. I also have extremely sensitive skin and psoriasis. A lot of eye creams tend to burn or irritate my skin but this one does not at all! Loved this so much I just purchased the full size! 
257310649, On Plump-Kin Retinol Eye Cream ,Suzanne,Normal,35-44, There is a lot of product - especially for the price. I haven't noticed a huge difference in my skin but it glides on nicely and I really enjoy using it. 
225529958, On Magic Beauty Shroom ,Janet H.,Dry,No," This is what a real essence feels like, literally the best thing. "
225529958, On Magic Beauty Shroom ,Emily W.,No,18-24," I just bought my second bottle of this toner, and I really love it. It makes my skin feel dewy, even, and moisturized. "
225529958, On Magic Beauty Shroom ,JessB,25-35,Dry," I've been using this daily in the morning since I received it a few weeks ago. It hasn't made me breakout, but I'm not sure it's really doing anything either. I thought it would be more moisturizing than it is for me. My skin is sensitive and tends to be dry in places during the winter. I've been having an issue with products creating redness and this doesn't do that. I'm just not sure if it really is a product I needed in my skincare routine. I agree with another reviewer that sometimes it feels like it wants to pill when applying. A little does go a long way. So if this product works well for you it is worth it. "
225529958, On Magic Beauty Shroom ,Taylor,Combination,No, I love how simple the ingredient list is 
225529958, On Magic Beauty Shroom ,Lily,No,35-44, Def hydrates my skin and feels good going on. Absorbs nicely but has a slightly strange texture (sort of pill-y) sometimes. 
208519418, On Hi Amino All Cleanser ,Angel,Combination,25-35, Smells like noxzema so the smell is strong if scent bothers you. Move on. I really enjoyed how the small sample that was sent to me smelled. Since I only got a sample I only gave 4 star cause I cant say how continued use does but from the sample I'm willing to try it! It cleaned thoroughly without making my skin feel tight or irritated. 
208519418, On Hi Amino All Cleanser ,Catharine,Combination,35-44," I really wanted to like this cleanser…a tiny bit goes a long way but as soon as I used it for the first time, my skin got right and also itchy and got redness on my face.  "
208519418, On Hi Amino All Cleanser ,Pachia,Combination,35-44,Also it smells very much like medicine 
247390435, On Real Ferment Micro Toner ,AyMay,Combination,25-35, But I don’t feel like my skin gets any brighter. My licorice toner is still top notch! 
247390435, On Real Ferment Micro Toner ,Glynis N.,Dry,55+, Holy grail (but the bottle got smaller) 
247390435, On Real Ferment Micro Toner ,Jennifer K.,Combination,25-35, I absolutely love this one! It’s so light and hydrating! Water like consistency and barely any scent at all. Perfect for day and night. It does it’s job by keeping my face bright and hydrated throughout the day. This is one product I’d like to have year round!! 
247390435, On Real Ferment Micro Toner ,Jennifer P.,Combination,25-35," I immediately saw an improvement in texture and tone of my skin! Smooth, even toned and hydrated skin. Neogen Rocks! "
289135306, On Niacinamide Serum 12% Plus Zinc 2% ,Shawna,Oily,35-44, I have really big pores from years of not taking care of my skin and sleeping makeup on. I know y’all are cringing. This stuff though has really helped. I can see a noticeable difference. The only thing though I’d it is very drying and I have oily skin. It was making me peel. I switched to using every other day and that helped a lot. 
289135306, On Niacinamide Serum 12% Plus Zinc 2% ,sarah,Dry,18-24, i always come back to this product as it has saved my skin over and over again ! 
289135306, On Niacinamide Serum 12% Plus Zinc 2% ,Neil,Combination,18-24, Leaves my skin so even and helps reduce my breakouts!! Would repurchase 
289135306, On Niacinamide Serum 12% Plus Zinc 2% ,Martha H.,Oily,25-35," This serum has clean, effective ingredients that your skin will love. Naturium products never disappoint. Leaves my skin hydrated and refreshed. "
289135306, On Niacinamide Serum 12% Plus Zinc 2% ,Sarah,Dry,18-24, one of the few niacinimide serums that didn’t ruin my skin it was super nice !!! 
267730423, On Vita C Plus Spot Correcting & Firming Ampoule ,Mae W.,Normal,35-44, Just got this and have been using for a week! It’s a little thick in consistency but goes on very smoothly. It has a citrusy scent which I don’t mind. I like it so far! 
267730423, On Vita C Plus Spot Correcting & Firming Ampoule ,Joanna B.,Dry,55+, Product absorbs easily and doesn’t feel sticky. It had lightened up some discoloration on my face. I highly recommend it. It was recommended to me by the Soko aesthetician. 
267730423, On Vita C Plus Spot Correcting & Firming Ampoule ,Ecub,Sensitive,25-35, I am using it for a month now. Observing that my dark spots are fading. Will keep using it. Leaves the skin very soft 
267730423, On Vita C Plus Spot Correcting & Firming Ampoule ,tania,Normal,35-44," Really enjoy this serum, my skin feels firmer and brighter "
267730423, On Vita C Plus Spot Correcting & Firming Ampoule ,Rochelle G.,Normal,>55, She says it makes her feel young and I've seen some difference in her face so far. 
236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Skylar,25-35,25-35, I don’t wear makeup but I love using this balm. A tiny bit goes a long way and I just love how it smells. The first time I used it it seemed to pull up a ton of yucky stuff out of my pores. Love this. 
236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Nicole D.,Normal,55+," I’m in love with this cleansing balm. First of all, it’s pink so I was immediately happy. It completely melted into my skin and it thoroughly cleaned my skin. Lastly, I love the smell. Overall, it just feels luxurious to me. I definitely want to repurchase. "
236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Alexus,Combination,18-24," This was a great oil cleanser that smelled nice and worked well! The product itself is great! I just didn't like the packaging. The lid broke early on so I was no longer able to screw it back on. It was just awkward and an inconvenience for it to then on, have no lid. "
236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Elena,Normal,25-35, Gave me one of my worst breakouts in years! Something I love about oil cleansing is the way it leaves your skin feeling moisturized. This one doesn’t do that. Don’t buy this. There are so many other good ones like Enature’s moringa balm 
105354188, On Rice Purifying Foaming Cleanser ,Emily C.,Sensitive,25-35," After suffering with severe sensitivity that included redness and swelling, I switched my skin care to a 2-step cleanse. I've been using this foam cleaner for nearly a year now, through all 4 seasons, and my face has done very well with this product. During the winter, it has become a bit more drying but a good moisturizer to follow does the trick. "
105354188, On Rice Purifying Foaming Cleanser ,Hannah B.,Combination,35-44,"The only issue I have is the the pump sticking and not returning to the upright position after pumping. This has happened on my last two bottles but it doesn't change my decision for 5 stars, just needs packing improvements. "
105354188, On Rice Purifying Foaming Cleanser ,Jazzmine H.,Oily,25-35, nice product 
105354188, On Rice Purifying Foaming Cleanser ,Anastaseya,Combination,25-35," I wanted a foam cleanser for traveling to replace my usual Soon Jung foaming cleanser, and this was a great choice except I didn’t like the smell very much. The smell is very mild though, so it wasn’t a big deal. "
212900856, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Eye Serum ,Carrie,Dry,35-44," This eye serum is fantastic for hydration and fine lines. I keep it in my skincare fridge, so when I apply the eye serum, it's nice and cool. I have been using the serum for the last three months, and during that time, I have found that it has actually gotten rid of 90% of the dark circles under my eyes, making them look much brighter. The only downside that I've found is that for me it doesn't do anything for the puffiness on the days when I don't get enough sleep. "
212900856, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Eye Serum ,Ashli A.,Dry,25-35, I’ve never had this kind of applicator before and I have to say I’m not sure I’m a fan. I tried this eye serum because I like their moisturizer but I’m not sure that this is doing anything for me. 
212900856, On Real Complexion Hyaluron Eye Serum ,Lily V.,Oily,18-24,We are so sorry to hear this product did not work out for you. Please reach out to us via e-mail with your order number and we'll be happy to get you all sorted! 
91716358, On Fresh Herb Origin Serum ,Courtney,Combination,25-35, This stuff smells very good. I have figured out The mask version is great. Using the bottled version every night on my face was too much. I started using it on my décolletage and neck though and I’m honestly on my 4th bottle. I love it and it’s really brightened up the skin. 
91716358, On Fresh Herb Origin Serum ,Jennifer C.,Combination,45-55," I had an inclination toward this stuff and I was correct. It's a little tacky when it first touches the skin, but it really helps absorb sheet mask serums and moisturizer. "
91716358, On Fresh Herb Origin Serum ,Cheryl,Combination,25-35," This personally clogged my pores and didn’t work for my combo skin type, but I know of others who love it. "
308904184, On Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream ,Tara V.,35-44, No, Doesn’t feel greasy or creasy ! Moisturizing for atriums the eyes and helps with circles under the eyes . 
308904184, On Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream ,Mei L., No,Puffiness/DarkCircles, Like this eye cream. I noticed a slight difference in the texture of the skin around my eyes. 
308904184, On Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream ,Marcelline F.,Loss of Firmness,45-54, Love this eye cream! Minimizes fine lines. No burning my eyes. 
308904184, On Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream ,Rhonda P.,55-64, No," I have been using this for about two weeks. It might have helped my crows feet and under eyes a bit, but I will need to continue with it, and time will tell. "
308904184, On Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream ,Megan K., No,Fine Lines/Wrinkles," I’ve been using this eye cream for about seven months now, morning and night. I’ve been trying to figure out a routine that works with my very sensitive, dry skin, and this has worked, while helping to combat the aging/tightening skin around my eyes. I find I can’t use a full pump-it is too much and would leave a shiny film that I am not going to wait to absorb. I do also use on patches of dry skin to keep them from flaking as much. Basically, I quite like this product. I might prefer a cream texture, but this has worked well for me. "
49905065, On Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack ,Delilah S.,Combination,25-35, I would have rated it higher but I did not realize it doesn't go on the sides of my nose. I would rather have a strip that covers my entire nose. 
49905065, On Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack ,Tt Q.,Combination,25-35, Sheet masks 
49905065, On Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack ,Nicoletta I.,Combination,18-24, This works a lot better than other pore strips I’ve tried and you can see the dirt on the strip afterwards! I keep buying more! 
49905065, On Tako Pore One Shot Nose Pack ,Nicoletta I.,Combination,18-24, This works a lot better than other pore strips and you actually see the dirt on the strip when you take it off! I keep buying more of these and definitely recommend. 
255648277, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Mask ,Shelby D.,Sensitive,Yes," I liked this mask a lot. I wouldn't consider it the most moisturizing mask I've ever used, but my skin felt prepped and ready for my next skincare steps. I'm not sure about it's claims of evening out my skin, but ultimately I think it helped the other products soak in after it. I also felt like my skin looked fresh afterwards. The mask itself is soaked in product. I used the excess on my chest and literally both of my arms, both felt great after. Overall would recommend. "
255648277, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Mask ,Karlie,Yes,25-35, The mask is made of a thick material that absorbs a lot of product and really left my face moisturized. My skin has been getting drier during the transition into fall and this was a great addition to my skincare routine. Would definitely purchase again! 
255648277, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Mask ,Ari,25-35,Dry," I’m writing this review after having just taken the mask off, and, WOW! I wasn’t sure what to expect from this product, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The first thing I noticed when I took the mask out was how drenched in serum it was, definitely a good sign. Besides that, the actual material of the mask felt very thick and of high quality. Not so thick that it was uncomfortable, but not as thin and flimsy as some other sheet masks I’ve tried. I left it on for 20 minutes per the instructions, and my skin felt quite soft and hydrated. I didn’t immediately notice any irritation on my reactive, combo skin, so I’m happy about that. All in all, I enjoyed this mask and would likely try it again. "
154020837, On Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream ,Mona,Dry,25-35," Made my skin much more hydrated, less dry, and more clear. I recommend for those with dry skin "
154020837, On Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream ,Anna,Combination,18-24," this is my new holy grail. i'm on tretinoin and the sides of my face are dry while my t-zone gets super oily throughout the day. this moisturizer is perfect for my crazy skin! it feels like an ointment but goes on smooth (leaves a sort of satin-y finish, like a primer). it's not wet or liquid-y at all but it is super moisturizing for every section of my face. it noticeably helps me control oil production around my nose and forehead. i do get hormonal acne and this doesn't agitate my skin or ever make me breakout; it's super gentle. i put this on right before i do my makeup and it helps my foundation go on beautifully. i wear makeup often and was looking for the right moisturizer to go underneath for so long. this is a great moisturizer and primer in one and can be used day and night. the only thing is that it's a bit pricey and the tube runs out fast if you use it every day. in my opinion, it's worth it! "
154020837, On Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream ,Alexis B.,Dry,25-35," I was looking for a moisturizer that could combat my dry skin, which is actually a new development for me. I used to have ‘normal’ skin, but I noticed it was feeling really dry suddenly. My skin does NOT absorb shea butter very well so was having a hard time finding a moisturizer for dry skin without that ingredient. Gave the Super Ceramide 100 Renewal Cream a try and YES MA’AM it works!! And it’s not heavy feeling AT ALL, which is so surprising considering the thick texture. It isn’t clogging my pores or any negative impacts on the rest of my skincare routine. I am almost finished with my first tube after around 3 months of use and just bought a second one. My new go-to! "
154020837, On Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream ,RMC,Sensitive,25-35," I have sensitive skin (eczema, highly prone to rashes) and this moisturizer is my go-to when I want to hydrate my skin. On the rare occasion that I end up wearing make-up, I always follow my cleanse routine and then use this moisturizer as a primer for a smooth and hydrating base to prevent any flaking for a smooth BB cream application. I don't use this moisturizer daily as it's relatively pricey for less than 2fl oz, but it's great for travel and whenever you feel the need to deeply hydrate. It doesn't leave your skin oily and absorbs quickly, but it does go on thicker than a daily facial lotion. "
154020837, On Super Ceramide 100™ Renewal Cream ,Elysia L.,Normal,35-44, I like this moisturizer. It is heavier than I am used to but it absorbs fairly quickly and doesn’t leave my face feelings greasy or oily. 
251150253, On Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream ,Rachel S.,Combination,25-35, It’s a rich moisturizer that hydrates your skin and leaves it soft. It doesn’t get your skin greasy. It’s perfect for winter time when your skin is very dry or when you need that well balanced hydration to fight fine lines. I love it everything it does for my skin. 
251150253, On Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream ,Tracy T.,Combination,25-35, Love this cream from Saturday Skin. The texture is whipped and creamy but light and absorbs into the skin well. It just feels very nourishing and the ingredients are top notch! 
251150253, On Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream ,Esther S.,Combination,35-44," I have never loved a Moisturizer as much as this. I have oily, dry, normal and sensitive skin depending on where on my face. I asked the skin concierge to recommend a cream to help even out tone and texture while hydrating my skin and I'm so glad I listened to them and gave this a try. This sinks deeply into my skin and I actually feel like it hydrates my skin several layers deep. I've also seen an improvement in tone and texture and it works great at night and during the day under makeup. Really a little goes a long way. The key to applying this is take a small pea sized amount, warm between fingers and then smooth and press into the skin. If you apply straight to face it feels thick but when you warm up first, it melts into an almost serum like texture. Best part is the results! Cant say enough good things about this. LOVE! "
251150253, On Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream ,Allyson R.,Dry,25-35, This cream is gorgeous. It’s PACKED with incredible ingredients. It’s perfect for day or night. I like it for day and it looks bomb under makeup and sunscreen. I will be repurchasing 
251150253, On Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream ,darla m.,Normal,35-44, This cream is very good. I use it at night for my bedtime routine and it leaves my skin feeling soft the next morning. 
282430930, On Pure Cleansing Oil ,Sarah G.,Sensitive,35-44, I love to double cleanse and this oil makes it easy to do. It is light yet effective in removing all the city grime and makeup. A beautiful texture and barely there scent. I then follow with my cream cleanser. 
282430930, On Pure Cleansing Oil ,maddieskin,Combination,18-24," I am a skin care junkie, but this cleansing oil is so amazing that I tried it once two years ago, and have never used another oil cleanser since. It is so gentle. The packaging is also amazing, which makes it easy to bring on trips with me. "
231509694, On VITALIFT-A Eye & Neck ,Regina I.,Combination,No," This is a nice eye cream but when I first started applying this at night, the area around my eyes and neck would get red "
231509694, On VITALIFT-A Eye & Neck ,tania,No,25-35," Used entire bottle in 3wk because its so small, no difference and even felt drying "
231509694, On VITALIFT-A Eye & Neck ,Sooah C.,35-44,Normal,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
231509694, On VITALIFT-A Eye & Neck ,Samira S.,Oily,No," It's not the strongest retinol, so you won't get the best results. I compared it to a higher retinol formula I've been using for years. There is a stronger version of this eye cream from this brand. I'm trying that next. "
225274056, On Pore Cleansing Balm BHA ,Mandy G.,Combination,35-44, This is my favourite cleansing balm. It melts as you massage it onto your skin and the smell is divine! My face feels squeaky clean without the uncomfortable stretchy feel! Love it!! 
225274056, On Pore Cleansing Balm BHA ,KD,Dry,18-24," Pleasant scent, melts makeup easily, and I'm noticing that it clears out my pores better than a couple of other cleansing balms. "
225274056, On Pore Cleansing Balm BHA ,victoria l.,Sensitive,18-24, this is so good at taking off my makeup and sunscreen products! it smells mild and is not irritating at all! I would definitely buy it again. 
225274056, On Pore Cleansing Balm BHA ,Milk,Combination,18-24, This cleanser has helped my skin sooo much and has reduced my pores by a lot. 
225274056, On Pore Cleansing Balm BHA ,Carlo S.,Combination,18-24," This balm completely melts when it meets water. It is a great summer balm, it helps brighten the mood with its citrus scent. The included spatula also helps scoop the balm. "
10134035, On Nutrinature All-In-One Multitem ,Ruth,Sensitive,25-35," I miss the old rose scent. The new scent smells heavily of tea tree, which is not my favorite. BUT this all-in-one moisturizing magic concoction is still one of my favorites. I use it when I’m having one of my lazy days. It keeps me moisturized and happy! "
10134035, On Nutrinature All-In-One Multitem ,Wolf,Combination,25-35," Sometimes I just cannot do all the steps in my routine. This was absolutely perfect. Worked well with my sensitive, acne prone, and combination skin. I just wish the price was a bit better. But it was kind of my holy grail for tough times. "
10134035, On Nutrinature All-In-One Multitem ,Minna C.,Oily,45-55," I bought this product is for convenience when traveling. So, don’t have to carry 3 different bottles. However, after putting it on, it is sticky and a bit oily. After putting a thin layer moisturizer and a layer of sunblock, it is more sticky and oily. I had to use tissue to get rid of the oil after 10-15 minutes of putting them on. I hope they make this all-in-one multitem for oily skin and make it less oily. I have some outbreak at my forehead and my chin, but not too bad. However, I still consider purchase more for its convenience, especially when I have to get out of the door quickly! Still love this, but again, if they can make it for oily skin, that will be perfect! "
10134035, On Nutrinature All-In-One Multitem ,Fraun C.,Sensitive,>55, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
225529943, On Mindful Bubble Cleanse ,Emily C.,Dry,No," Love the way this smells, it smells kind of luxurious. "
225529943, On Mindful Bubble Cleanse ,Aitor S.,No,18-24, I use it as body wash and I can see how it vanishes the little pimples caused by sweating from working out. The scent is so calming too! 
225529943, On Mindful Bubble Cleanse ,Sarah L.,25-35,Sensitive, I received this product in my Ispy bag and fell in love. My skin just feels amazing after each use. I have not found a better product out there for my skin. 
225529943, On Mindful Bubble Cleanse ,Anne R.,Sensitive,No," first off, i'm in love with the (non-fragranced) scent––think herbal, citrus, mint. but more importantly, i have really important needs when it comes to a cleanser: i like foam cleansers but I also really need something gentle that doesn't totally strip my skin, but the best gentle cleansers often come in a gel-type... this one is perfect. it's so gentle, it foams, and it cleans my skin perfectly. with my consistent skincare routine, i noticed a difference in that my skin looked clearer and felt lighter! in other words, this cleanser practically doubled the absorbency of my products. don't buy this if you don't like foam or if u expect this product alone to do something... it works best by amplifying what's already in your routine. but if you have your routine all worked out, don't hesitate to add this to your bathroom counter!!  "
225529943, On Mindful Bubble Cleanse ,Dominique M.,No,45-55," I really like this cleanser, and a little really does go a long way. It doesn't dry my skin out, nor does it irritate my skin. It feels gentle but also like it works. "
255648251, On Bifida Biome Complex Ampoule ,Siobhan S.,Combination,Yes," The combination of this ampoule and the Manyo toner cleared up a stubborn breakout and lingering redness in two days. I love the texture of it (little product is needed) and my skin has appeared much more even after one week of usage. I have used the Inward Agas ACue serum for almost two years, so this is a great alternative, especially with colder weather approaching. "
255648251, On Bifida Biome Complex Ampoule ,Linhdan,Yes,25-35, I love the dropper that comes with this. The ampoule is lightweight and absorbs quickly. My skin looks calm and heathy since using it. 
255648251, On Bifida Biome Complex Ampoule ,Nikki,25-35,Combination," Before I started using this ampoule, I had a few breakouts, bumps, and redness on my face, which I presume is from a disrupted skin barrier. The morning after I used this ampoule, I noticed my skin looking a bit more calm and smoother. After a few more uses, my skin has started clearing up a bit. I'm not sure if it's because of this ampoule specifically that's helping, but the addition of it to my routine has definitely improved my skin texture. This is a product that I will most definitely be keeping in my routine! "
255648251, On Bifida Biome Complex Ampoule ,Elizabeth C.,Combination,Yes," I love a good ampule. I was going through some hormonal break outs and I paired this up with a vitamin c and together it visibly reduced my pimples redness by more than 60%. And that's just in 1 night. The ampule sinks into your skin, it's not heavy and oily. The ampule is definitely worth trying. "
255648251, On Bifida Biome Complex Ampoule ,Karlie,Yes,18-24, Really great addition to my winter skincare routine! It's moisturizing without being too harsh. I can combine it with my exfoliating products and feel my skin is more vibrant after just a few uses. 
188810559, On Green Tangerine Vita C Toner Pad ,Anh V.,Combination,45-55, I bought a couple jars of this for my teenage son to fade his blemishes quicker but I'm loving using this toner pad on mornings when I don't feel like cleansing. My skin feels clean and hydrated after using it. 
188810559, On Green Tangerine Vita C Toner Pad ,M P.,Oily,35-44, Best part of my morning routine. Instantly refreshes my skin and makes me feel energised. 
188810559, On Green Tangerine Vita C Toner Pad ,Lucy A.,Combination,35-44," it's excellent to get rid of dirt and unseen particles stuck on your face at the end of the day. I love the scent, it's refreshing. I have sensitive and combination skin. Although it cleaned my face well but left my face red for a while. I use it once or twice a week for now. "
188810559, On Green Tangerine Vita C Toner Pad ,Denise C.,Combination,25-35, I love this product. I used to use the serum and recently bought this to use in the morning when I have to dash out my place. The pads are big to cover large areas of the face. One quick swipe on all four sides and I’m ready to apply the rest of my skincare routine. My face looks brighter and more even toned. 
188810559, On Green Tangerine Vita C Toner Pad ,Bridgett Z.,Sensitive,25-35, Love this product my third time buying after trying the trial pack with the sample eye patches and serum which i also love these wipes make my skin feel fresh and non drying they also have lighten my dark spots a great product 
140973440, On Calming Clear Milk Peel Cleansing Balm ,Robin E.,Combination,45-55," Absolutely adore this product, makes my skin so soft and smooth without irritation. "
140973440, On Calming Clear Milk Peel Cleansing Balm ,Mia M.,Sensitive,25-35," As a person with moderately sensitive skin, I am always a bit wary when adding in an exfoliant to my routine. **HOWEVER** this cleansing balm is so light and refreshes my skin after each use. I have combo/sensitive skin with my t-zone being the prime area for where I get clogged pores and hormonal breakouts. I have to say that even after a few uses my pores were noticeably smaller and clear. This product will definitely be a staple in my routine. "
140973440, On Calming Clear Milk Peel Cleansing Balm ,Iris,Combination,25-35," I liked it when I first started using it, partially because I liked the idea of a balm so traveling with it is less of a mess, but after I tried a regular cleaning oil I realized this didn't do as good of a job getting the daily grime off my skin. Soo there's nothing wrong with it but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. "
225764008, On Oasis Soothing Mask ,Rose,Sensitive,18-24," At first I bought this just because of the packaging, but the masks are very hydrating and great for sensitive skin. I will buy again! "
225764008, On Oasis Soothing Mask ,K.K.,Normal,25-35," Hydrating and soothing and most importantly, doesn't break me out! Would repurchase again. "
225764008, On Oasis Soothing Mask ,Lauren W.,Combination,25-35, The mask itself is so soft! It leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and soothed. Will buy again and again! 
225764008, On Oasis Soothing Mask ,Jessica H.,Sensitive,25-35, Worth trying 
80494481, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Serum ,Baeleigh,Combination,25-35, Something about products with snail in them cause me to break out. I had removed everything new in my regime to determine the cause of my new breakouts and these weird bumps I got and determined it was this product. Don’t know if it’s my sensitive skin but I didn’t like it 
80494481, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Serum ,Danielle B.,Combination,45-55,"Thanks for your feedback!

218040378, On Let's Carrot Multi Oil ,Robyn,Dry,35-44," This is a great serum! It has such a nice texture, didn't make my skin feel greasy or sticky at all. I do think I notice visible improvement in my skin as well, for hydration. Loved it. "

268794785, On Kill Lash Superproof Mascara ,ngan,Combination,25-35, I really like how thin the wand is because the product clump less and is easy to apply on both upper and lower lashes. I do see some lengthening and the product does last long hours.  
268794785, On Kill Lash Superproof Mascara ,Leonor,Combination,25-35,"The only minus point I can see is that when I just curl my lashes and apply the product, the curl doesn't hold super well after a couple of hours. "
224782903, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ve (Glow) ,Becca,Normal,25-35, The serum is really thick and the applicator doesn't work super well. Is also pretty small compared to other products on Soko at a similar price point. 
224782903, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ve (Glow) ,caquilina1,Normal,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
224782903, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ve (Glow) ,Trishina A.,Combination,25-35, Has a goopy consistency and a weird applicator. Also there's not enough product in the bottle so it's hard to tell if it's provided any results before running out. 
224228741, On Yuja Niacin Brightening Peeling Gel ,Berchisannie m.,Combination,25-35, Brighting skin great smell nice have use daily 
224228741, On Yuja Niacin Brightening Peeling Gel ,Ari Z.,Combination,18-24," Love how bright and clean it leaves my skin, and it is very gentle as it smooths out the skin! "
224228741, On Yuja Niacin Brightening Peeling Gel ,G,Normal,18-24," i've been using this for the past few weeks, and am amazed at how well this peeling gel exfoliates my skin! i've used other peeling gels like this, but none of them have made my skin feel as soft and moisturized as this one. 5/5 stars for me! "
224228741, On Yuja Niacin Brightening Peeling Gel ,Bonnie G.,Combination,45-55," This is the first peeling gel I've used in a long time, and I really like it. My skin feels so soft afterwards. I took off one star because the removal process is very messy -- it gets everywhere! -- but the results speak for themselves. I also love that it contains Yuzu, a Vitamin C superstar. "
224228741, On Yuja Niacin Brightening Peeling Gel ,meenz,Combination,25-35," I was expecting this to be harsh but actually it is very gentle on the skin. I saw a difference in brightness even after the first use. Citrus scent, gentle on the skin, easy to wash off and leaves no residue. I use this everyday and my acne marks are fading rapidly. "
238922552, On Gentle Elements Cleansing Foam ,Charlene H.,Normal,55+, It definitely does clean your face but i think it for someone with oily skin it will be great 
238922552, On Gentle Elements Cleansing Foam ,Diana C.,Oily,18-24, I expected something different but it is still a nice cleanser. More creamier than I thought. Probably good for dry skin rather than oily 
238922552, On Gentle Elements Cleansing Foam ,Liz,Normal,25-35," My favorite cleanser I've ever used. I use it as the second step after a cleansing balm and my face is in love. At first I was like ... $34? For a daily cleanser? That size? But a little goes a LONG way with this stuff. A pea size amount is enough to lather over my whole face, so I tell it will last a good long while. "
257121942, On Lotus Water Calming Toner ,Stephanie,Sensitive,25-35," Almost every product recommended to me by SokoGlam's skin concierge has been a good one. However, I don't know what it is about this toner that causes me to have a reaction. Big disappointment. "
257121942, On Lotus Water Calming Toner ,Mozett C.,Oily,18-24,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
257121942, On Lotus Water Calming Toner ,Selena,Combination,18-24, This one my favorite of all. 
226705823, On Bubi Bubi Lip Mask ,Belial B.,Combination,35-44, I absolutely love this lip mask. I've been using it for 2 weeks now and my lips feel more plump and moisturized during the day. My lip stick goes on more smoothly and stays longer. I feel like there has been barrier repair. The formula texture is nice. It goes on like a thick lip balm. Not tacky or oily. No smell. Not much product is needed so the small volume will last for quite sometime. 
226705823, On Bubi Bubi Lip Mask ,Gemma S.,Combination,35-44, Legit love this product. My lips are soft. I put it on every night with my skincare routine. Just very easy to keep up with. My lips are conditioned. Love this. 
226705823, On Bubi Bubi Lip Mask ,Nicole,25-35,25-35," Everyone who says you can’t see the color is lying. Which is fine at night, but you can definitely see the color on your lips. Despite this, it’s a great product and is super moisturizing "
226705823, On Bubi Bubi Lip Mask ,belle,Combination,25-35," This was the only item I bought recently that I didn't feel I ""need"" and was a fun splurge. This lip mask is most definitely a need and I don't even get dry lips. I wake up and my lips do look smoother and just better. Plus it smells amazing and feels rich but not toooooo sticky. "
226705823, On Bubi Bubi Lip Mask ,Rachel B.,Combination,25-35," I’ve never used a lip mask before, but the Bubi Bubi Lip Mask has been the PERFECT first experience! Before this lip mask, I was having to reapply chapstick 4-6 times a day, and my lips still burned and felt dry. The FIRST night I used this lip mask, I only had to apply chapstick twice the next day! Now I only use chapstick once towards the end of the day. I LOVE this! "
247391946, On Rapid Firm Sculpting Cream ,Valerie P.,Dry,>55, Not sure if this product really reflects the results as described in the purchase/product description. I will not purchase this item nor recommend to someone. 
247391946, On Rapid Firm Sculpting Cream ,stefanie l.,Dry,18-24,We're so sorry to hear that this cream didn't work out for you. Please reach out to us at 
247391946, On Rapid Firm Sculpting Cream ,Nina G.,Combination,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Evie B.,Sensitive,25-35," I got this mask in a skin brightening mask pack, and I LOVED it, It tightened and brightened my skin, and left me with soft, supple clear skin. The scent was subtle and the remaining serum patted in so nicely, I sealed with my moisturiser and went about my day! LOVE! Can't wait for it to come back in stock! "
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Sam,Sensitive,25-35," Best sheet mask I have tried so far. It almost has a gel like texture and it feels so soothing on my skin. It doesn’t slide around my face while using it which was nice. Honestly, I didn’t even want to take it off. Will buy again for sure! "
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Jamie C.,Normal,25-35, Helps your skin recover from environmental stressors! Put it in the fridge to chill a bit and it’ll feel so refreshing! 
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Alex F.,Dry,18-24, I never write reviews but this sheet mask has become one of my all time favorites - and I've used a LOT. IT's extremely moisturizing and hydrating. If you don't like very wet sheet masks this might not be the one for you - but for someone with dry or dehydrated skin this is perfection. 
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Paloma N.,Oily,18-24, this face mask is so great for when skin is dry and irritated from cold weather 
308904052, On Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Chéy,18-24, No," I am currently wearing some as I write this. They are such a delightful treat after a long day. After using these eye patches, my under eyes look incredible and my skin feels so refreshed. "
308904052, On Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Morgan D., No,Other, I’ve tried quite a few eyepatches and I adore these. I actually put the smaller patches on my eyelids sometimes and they adhere quite well. I like to keep these in my skincare 
308904052, On Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Nancy H.,Combination,18-24, The second lid/ inner lid was really hard to pop / pull off. The product itself is great- but not if sure I will get again or if it’s even worth it due to how difficult it was to get the lid off. 
308904052, On Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Goldie C.,Dry,18-24, -1 star because opening the lid is a pain. I had to pry it off with tweezers after breaking the plastic cover because it would not budge (maybe too much mucin suction?).  
308904052, On Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Diane L.,Puffiness/DarkCircles,25-34,Otherwise it's great. I pop it in the fridge and use them whenever I exfoliate or use retinol to hydrate and soothe my skin. Fit well under my eyes/cheek and fits well under my mouth/on my chin. I have no issues with it sliding off. 
228433214, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Po (Pore Tightening) ,Carla V.,Combination,35-44, Have not used long enough to see if helps with what claims to help with. But my skin feels good after application. 
228433214, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Po (Pore Tightening) ,Nahee K.,Oily,<18," My sister has been using this for two weeks and she could see her pores shrinking and blackheads decreasing. She had severe acne on her cheeks, chin, and forehead. But after using this serum and moisturizer, her acne has lessened. "
228433214, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Po (Pore Tightening) ,Sina S.,Sensitive,35-44," Purchased this for the first time, gave it a 2 week trial and I can say it is working. It goes on velvety & it smells really nice. I have noticed my pores seems to be a minimizing around my cheeks & nose area. Will continue to purchase this in the future! "
228433214, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Po (Pore Tightening) ,Brittney,Oily,25-35," I bought this during the sale since I’ve been eyeing it for a while. I’ve used it 3 or 4 times and it really does what it claims. I have oily skin and when I wear this my pores look smoother and less visible. My skin is also less oily throughout the day. This makes an excellent makeup primer as well. I’ve tried it under tinted moisturizer and my skin looks so smooth and even. The texture is light and when you rub it into your skin, it leaves an almost velvety finish. I’d definitely buy this again. "
228433214, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Po (Pore Tightening) ,Brianna,Sensitive,18-24," I was gifted this product and I was super nervous because I have sensitive skin, but no bad reactions and I’ve been using this for a month now! This product product was perfect for my big pores, especially for skin care before makeup! Absolutely love love love and it minimizes my pores for sure! "
225529975, On Green Golden Ruler ,Saige R.,Dry,No," i have been using this for about a month and find that it's been really good for my dry skin. i haven't found it to be too sticky after application, it's just dewy! i also have very sensitive skin and it hasn't broken me out or irritated it at all. a little goes a long way; i haven't even made a dent in it. i will be repurchasing for sure! "
225529975, On Green Golden Ruler ,Fii,No,25-35," I was really looking forward to this product and the initial application was truly so refreshing and soothing. But, the product doesn't seem to sink into the skin and though it provided a nice glow, I was left with a very sticky face. "
225529975, On Green Golden Ruler ,Mel,25-35,Combination," This is my new ""night cream,"" and I love it! The ingredients are awesome, it feels good on my skin, and it helped sooth some irritation I had from a glycolic acid toner I used this week. Personally, I feel it is a little too heavy for me for daytime use (I have combo skin), but I had bought this with the intention of using it at night only, so that's fine with me. "
225529975, On Green Golden Ruler ,Melissa D.,Combination,No," I am using this as my new night cream, and I love it! My skin feels soft, moisturized, and has a lovely glow. Love the ingredients, too. "
225529975, On Green Golden Ruler ,Jrios,No,25-35," Using this product in 90+ degree weather it is silky, glides right on and has an airy feeling to it also no fragrance is a big plus. "
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,AshleyNQuinn,Dry,25-35, It’s really moisturizing but it pulls soooo bad especially if you are layering it :( I might have to stick it in my night routine instead. 
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Jaina F.,Oily,18-24, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Abby,Combination,<18," i'm really on the fence about this cream, on the one hand it is really hydrating for my skin and doesn't leave a greasy residue like other creams with oils in them (especially since i have oily skin) and i definitely think my face is a lot more clearer since i've been using it. however, it really smells like celery (it disappears in a few minutes) and whenever i use my sunscreen after (either a matte one or a water-based one) my skin begins to flake, as if the cream is causing the sunscreen to start peeling off my face. it makes my skin look like it's flaking :(( "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,Cinta,Combination,18-24," This eye cream is very moisturizing and easily applied to the skin. You only need a small amount and there’s so much that comes in the tube. Just with a couple uses of it, I already see and feel a difference in the moisture of my under eyes. Not sure of other claims but I use it for the moisturizing properties "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,nicxnic,Dry,25-35," I was recommended this eye cream from the Soko Glam team and have loved it since. It's light and moisturizing with a really pleasant scent that reminds me of fruity pebbles. For me, I liked it better than the Etude House Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream because it seemed to hydrate a bit better for longer. "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,Erin,Normal,35-44," I bought this after using a Nacific sheet mask and really enjoying the fresh herbal scent and results. This eye cream is nice for PM use (too sticky/too long to absorb for my daytime routine) but at my age I need a thicker, bouncier, firming eye cream for night that targets wrinkles. So this won’t be a repurchase for me, but for a younger person looking for a solid PM eye cream as a preventative and moisturizing measure, this could be a great choice. "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,Katie L.,Combination,45-55, I actually got this product in my monthly Ipsy bag. I love it! I really wanted a product that would brighten my eye area and this has worked a lot better than the former cream I was using. The fact that it is clean and cruelty-free makes it a winner in my book! 
308904394, On Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner ,Mai,Combination,25-35," I've been using this along with the COSRX Snail 92. It's worked wonders on my skin, keeping it well hydrated. The toner is thicker compared to others that I have, but I don't mind it since I own serums that are similar in consistency. "
308904394, On Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner ,Diana G.,Dry,25-35," I have dry sensitive skin. And this toner is great! It is hydrating and it doesn’t burn. I’ve always had a particular dry patch on my left face cheek for years, I’m talking years, and this toner along with the Cosrx propolis ampoule and face cream smoothed out all dry texture on my face including that dry patch. And thats when I realized I have found my holy grail products. "
308904394, On Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner ,Camille,Combination,25-35, Propolis is an amazing ingredient for the skin! Definitely moisturizing and helps with texture. I do prefer it in a serum rather than a toner. I think this toner feels too sticky and not as potent as I want it for propolis. 
308904394, On Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner ,SG,Oily,25-35," my skin definitely loved this product! i bought this in aug and its the 2nd of nov and im close to running out, will be repurchasing cause it’s that good "
308904394, On Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner ,Ash M.,Sensitive,25-35, First bought when the supply chain made my normal toner impossible to find.  
186812586, On Egg Mellow Cream ,Gwen B.,Dry,25-35," This face lotion is a little heavy and slow to absorb. I much prefer gel creams over something like this. The first couple of times I used it, it made me break out. I have somewhat sensitive skin, but it tends to be dry and breakouts are rarely ever a problem for me. I can’t imagine someone with oily or combination skin could use this and not have problems. It’s also kind of strongly scented, and not a scent that I enjoy. I will probably return it. "
186812586, On Egg Mellow Cream ,Emily V.,Combination,35-44, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
186812586, On Egg Mellow Cream ,Sandy,Combination,35-44," I love this product but it's a bit too much as a day moisturizer for my skin. Great overnight but leaves my skin a bit greasy by the time I wake up. My husband has drier skin and loves it for any time of day. I may use it during they day in the drier winter months but it's overkill in the summer months, for me. "
186812586, On Egg Mellow Cream ,Justine R.,Dry,18-24," I have combination skin, but lately during the colder months, my skin has been feeling extra dry. The egg mellow cream not only hydrated my skin, it was gentle enough that it was soothing to my sensitive skin and left my face feeling smooth. It’s my favorite moisturizer. A little goes a long way. "
161994530, On Agas ACue Serum ,Victorya,Normal,25-35," I purchased this product back in September when I had gone back to work full time so that meant wearing two masks for 8+hours everyday. This product has helped me control my maskne so much! After two weeks of use I noticed the small irritated bumps around my chin and jaw have gone down. Since then, I've repurchased twice! It also helps keep the oils in my T-zone in control! "
161994530, On Agas ACue Serum ,Elijah W.,Normal,18-24, Smells really good 
161994530, On Agas ACue Serum ,Taylor T.,Oily,25-35, I have really oily skin that’s acne prone and I was looking for a good niacinamide serum that wouldn’t make my skin more oily. So far so good with this one! Makes my skin a little bit tacky after applying but feels fine with moisturizer. No breakouts so far with it at all 
161994530, On Agas ACue Serum ,Holly,Oily,25-35, I bought this after a recommendation from a skin concierge for my oily and hormonal breakouts. I've used it for a few months now 3-4 days on and couple days off. Hasn't really done anything for me and I'm just as oily if not more and continued to have breakouts. Pretty disappointed since it was recommended so highly by the skin concierge and its quite pricey compared to other products on Soko Glam. 
161994530, On Agas ACue Serum ,Johnny,Combination,25-35, I've been using this product for about 2 months now. I do not recommend it. The product leaves a super greasy look and it also looks very glowy on top of that. I purchased both the serum and cream and have been very disappointed with both products. It feels very sticky when you apply it and it does have a mild smell some might consider strong. It is a good amount of serum but not worth the price or the hassle. 
186812840, On Egg Remedy Hair Pack ,Robin P.,Combination,35-44," I have long, thick, wavy, and red died hair. It is damaged and many shampoos and conditioners do not work. I had recently received a purchase for hair products from Soko Glam and it worked great, so I said to give this a shot. I left it in for about 10 minutes and when I rinsed my hair was so soft and easy to brush. The end result smooth tangle free locks! A must try! "
186812840, On Egg Remedy Hair Pack ,Vivian F.,Combination,25-35," A little bit thick for my liking, I thought it will be more like a cream, I didn't see any change after I used, my hair is thick, no like 4C or something like that, but thick and treatment with a paste consistency didn't work for me "
186812840, On Egg Remedy Hair Pack ,Charlene H.,Normal,55+, My hair is extremely coarse and dry it really made my hair soft just after one treatment it is very rich 
186812840, On Egg Remedy Hair Pack ,Navyata N.,Combination,18-24,Iam glad I purchased it this hair cream 
186812840, On Egg Remedy Hair Pack ,Madalyn W.,Combination,25-35, My hair looked so much healthier after just a few times using this 
80494734, On 7 Wonders Mediterranean Olive Brightening Mask ,Candice,Sensitive,25-35, Love this mask it left my skin feeling hydrated and it looked more even. I recommend using these items before you apply makeup 
80494734, On 7 Wonders Mediterranean Olive Brightening Mask ,Cassidy A.,Oily,25-35," This mask was kinda hard to handle, the instructions weren't exactly right as there were protective gauze on both sides that needed to be taken off. It was a little hard to get on, but stayed on well one I got it on. I liked the jelly like soft texture of the mask itself. "
186812154, On Egg-zyme Whipped Foam ,Rachael,Combination,25-35, This face wash has lots of fragrance but more importantly leaves an almost sticky residue like cheap soaps do on the skin. Very disappointed with this product. I suggest Good Light cosmic dew instead. 
186812154, On Egg-zyme Whipped Foam ,Cheryl,Dry,18-24,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
186812154, On Egg-zyme Whipped Foam ,Loreal M.,Normal,45-55," okay i’m picky when it comes to face wash but this is UNREAL. it foams really well, doesn’t leave my skin feeling dry, and you only need a little bit and it goes a long way!! it hasn’t made me break out which is something i struggle with when trying new products. i really like the scent too! "
217822954, On TW-Real Bifida Ampoule ,Brooke,Normal,18-24, Love the ingredients. 
217822954, On TW-Real Bifida Ampoule ,K.K.,Dry,35-44," Purchased this for my mom and she didn't really see any changes in her skin after finishing the bottle. Her skin is slightly more nourished but there wasn't a brightening or smoothing effect seen. Maybe this is better for the younger folks, whose wrinkles or spots haven't been around for too long. "
217822954, On TW-Real Bifida Ampoule ,Katherine P.,Dry,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
208521012, On Real Aqua Balancing Ampoule ,Hannah,Combination,25-35," I had dehydrated skin for a long time without realizing it - I always thought it was just dry because dry and dehydrated skin present the same (dry). Dry skin is treated with oil/ceramides, while dehydrated skin needs water. No amount of oil improved my skin's hydration, however this little serum completely changed my skin! My skin is back to a normal water content and is dewy and lovely, and my barrier is restored. This serum is excellent for dehydrated skin - I've tried other water based serums but this is my favorite, I'm on my 5th bottle with no plans of stopping. I highly recommended IF your skin is dehydrated. I've seen a few reviews saying it didn't work for them - could be that they need oil not water. If you feel like your skin is dry but nothing helps, give this serum a try! "
208521012, On Real Aqua Balancing Ampoule ,Nicole H.,Sensitive,25-35," I've struggled to find a good serum or ampoule that hydrates my skin without clogging my pores. This doesn't clog my pores resulting in a break out or cystic acne the next morning, but it also is only mildly hydrating. It's thin and watery, and barely feels like I'm adding any additional moisture. Maybe 10%. I'll finish the bottle, but definitely wouldn't repurchase. "
208521012, On Real Aqua Balancing Ampoule ,neil,Oily,25-35," Had high hopes for this, but didn't hydrate as much as I would've loved! "
208521012, On Real Aqua Balancing Ampoule ,Kate,Sensitive,45-55,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
228105762, On Vitamin C Glow Capsule Lotion ,Vanessa,Combination,18-24, Received a sample of this product with one of my orders. Felt my skin get softer over a few days. Need to purchase a full bottle of this stuff. It's the best! 
228105762, On Vitamin C Glow Capsule Lotion ,Cindy C.,Sensitive,35-44, I started with the sample and went from there. No breakouts and I've notice the difference with my dark spots. Thanks! 
228105762, On Vitamin C Glow Capsule Lotion ,Kelsey,Normal,35-44, This has been one of my favorite moisturizers! It really went far and felt smooth with no residue! I love the ingredients and the vitamin C capsules!just an overall very well formulated moisturizer! 
228105762, On Vitamin C Glow Capsule Lotion ,Emily,Combination,25-35, It's a great lightweight face lotion for the summertime but a little too lightweight for cold winter. 
228105762, On Vitamin C Glow Capsule Lotion ,Karl M.,Normal,25-35," This feels like a light moisturizer. Application was great but after a while, my face feels tight. I would layer another light moisturizer on top of this. Great packaging though! "
282431058, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Essence ,Angela L.,Combination,25-35, Great product. Leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated. Absorbs well. Would buy again. 
282431058, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Essence ,Amy,Dry,25-35," I brought this product because to get some extra skincare benefits. I’m dealing with a lot of irritation and redness at the moment. And since I’ve been using this, I’ve seen a difference. I really like this product, there is no scent and it absorbs quickly! "
282431058, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Essence ,Nadia,Combination,25-35," I use this product after the cleanser , I like the texture and accept well of the products that I put after it. "
282431058, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Essence ,Nolan M.,Sensitive,18-24, I have pretty sensitive skin and this helps keep it mellow all day long. It does have a slimy texture but it soaks in rather quick and doesn’t leave a sticky residue. Recommend for anyone who needs something to keep their skin calm all day 
282431058, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Essence ,Rachel N.,Sensitive,35-44, Instantly calms my skin. absorbs quickly. 
278682011, On ACV Vinegar Shampoo ,Jane S.,Combination,18-24," This works well for my scalp I think! I use it once a week, on alternating weeks. I like to pH balance my scalp, since it's really my scalp that needs the work. Smells like apple fragrance, and is a good ACV sulfate shampoo. "
278682011, On ACV Vinegar Shampoo ,DAR,25-35,25-35, Got this as an order gift and have reordered since. I find that it clears scalp debris/irritation without drying out my hair. Happy to have found this! 
278682011, On ACV Vinegar Shampoo ,Cindy Z.,Dry,18-24, I love using this product whenever I feel like my scalp has build up and needs to be purified! It leaves my head feeling very fresh afterward. 
278682011, On ACV Vinegar Shampoo ,Aitor S.,Sensitive,25-35, Cleanses all dirt and grime you collect throughout the day without stripping your hair from its naturals oils! 
278682011, On ACV Vinegar Shampoo ,Jennifer L.,Dry,35-44," It felt nice at first but just irritated my scalp as I continued using it. I had to stop. I wanted to like it and wished it could have helped my dry scalp, but it didn’t and I was losing more hair in the process. "
231509616, On VITALIFT-A ,MKA,Combination,No," I've been purchasing my skincare products exclusively from Soko for close to 4 years now and I'm a little ashamed to admit that I think this might be the first review I have written. I CANNOT live without this product. I use it mostly as a spot treatment but will occasionally use it all over my face. I feel like it's most effective as a spot treatment. I experience hormonal breakouts and will sometimes have a really deep cystic spot beginning to form. When that happens I will spot treat the area with this at night. If I can tell the breakout has extra potential, I'll use a tiny dab of it in the morning. This product makes my breakout completely disappear, and quickly. I have never used a product that works this well. 10000/10 "
231509616, On VITALIFT-A ,T Y.,No,25-35," Works well against acne and other irregularities on the face but against fine wrinkles or stronger, it doesn't work. Tretinoin is much better choice. "
231509616, On VITALIFT-A ,Hanna,45-55,Combination,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you.  "
140850776, On Acsen Oil Cut Cleansing ,ANDRA S.,Combination,35-44, I love this product and use it twice a day. It works in the morning by itself at gently removing the oil that accumulated overnight without drying out my skin. It works great as a second step after a cream cleanser to remove the last of my make up. 
140850776, On Acsen Oil Cut Cleansing ,Remy,Oily,35-44," This cleanser is nice but expensive for the amount you get. I also feel like I end up using more because it doesn't It doesn't really lather since it is oil-cut. It is not overly drying and has nice light and pleasing scent. I might use this as a travel combo cleaner when I don't want to bring both my oil cleaner and water-based cleaner. 5 stars for overall quality, 4 stars from a value for cost perspective. "
140850776, On Acsen Oil Cut Cleansing ,Chelsea N.,Oily,25-35," This cleanser removes *all* the oils from your skin. If you need that every now and again, it's great. When you need balance, it's not for the every day. "
140850776, On Acsen Oil Cut Cleansing ,Rita V.,Combination,35-44, This is definitely being added to my skin care routine. I love how it makes my skin look amazing! 
267730338, On Rose Quartz Gua Sha ,Jude,Combination,18-24, I love this gua sha! A great product for the price. I broke mine (dropped it on tile floor) so I am repurchasing. 
267730338, On Rose Quartz Gua Sha ,gabbi,Combination,25-35," I have a habit of clenching my jaw and that leads to tension headaches. Not only is this a great way to get the products absorbed into your skin, but is a wonderful way to massage my tight facial muscles. "
267730338, On Rose Quartz Gua Sha ,sarah c.,Combination,25-35, Pretty and does its job. 
267730338, On Rose Quartz Gua Sha ,Georgianna R.,Dry,>55," I like the shape of this gua sha - it’s easy to hold. I just received this so it’s too soon to say much. However, I have enjoyed using it and love the rose quartz. I am following the directions and I do see some changes in reduction of excess fluid in my face. "
229013568, On MadeCera Fresh Clearing Ampoule ,Kaylen C.,Oily,25-35, I wasn’t expecting too much because it seems watery at first but it feels great. My skin is less oily and feels fresh after using it. Def buying again. 
229013568, On MadeCera Fresh Clearing Ampoule ,MyChell,Combination,35-44," My skin has become more sensitive & dryer as I'm approaching my 40's, this is a great serum that's perfect for combo skin & Sensitive skin! It gently moisturizes the dry areas while Tea Tree keeps breakouts at bay! The HUGE size is Well worth the price; you definitely get what you pay for! I took a chance on this product and I'm so happy I did! I would recommend & purchase again! "
229013568, On MadeCera Fresh Clearing Ampoule ,l1lmiss,Combination,25-35," I was intrigued by the ingredients and its benefit claims so I tried it out. I was amazed by how big the bottle was! the teatree smell upon application is definitely noticeable but disappears almost immediately. It's runny, feels lightweight, and sinks in the skin almost immediately. I don't really notice any amazing aftereffects from application but when trying out new products and said product/s anger my skin and rebel, this ampoule definitely helps calm my skin tf down. It definitely feels hydrating too. To me, just the right amount of hydration. I like it overall! "
229013568, On MadeCera Fresh Clearing Ampoule ,Yunah P.,Oily,25-35, This really helps my face cool down.  
229013568, On MadeCera Fresh Clearing Ampoule ,Sooshi,Sensitive,25-35,Bottle is really big and you get so much product! 
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Nantana R.,Combination,45-55, It has a nice texture and easy to absorb on my face. But the scent is quick strong for my liking. 
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Karen C.,Dry,25-35," I bought this moisturizer for the humid DC summertime and have enjoyed it so far. It goes on light and absorbs quick, which is nice when I want to put it on and go to sleep. However, for the price, I won't be replacing the pot once it's over -- it's does its job but doesn't blow my mind. "
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Stephanie,Combination,25-35," I have been using this for several months, and it's a great moisturizer if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin. I was dealing with some hormonal acne just on my chin (normal skin type on rest of my face), and this leaves my skin hydrated without causing breakouts. I also have pretty sensitive skin and this is gentle with no harsh components. It has a slightly stretchy texture, but smells nice and a little goes a long way. I'm on my third jar of it, and would definitely recommend it for people with oily or combination or sensitive skin. "
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Tiffany,Combination,25-35, I like the way my skin feels after I use this. I have oily skin so this moisturizes my skin without making it greasy. There are 2 draw backs for me. One was the fact that it feels sticky as if you're putting glue on you face. The second was the smell. It's not super strong but I'm not a fan of the scent. 
235840447, On Enriched By Nature Cream ,JesSkin,Sensitive,No," This is such a lovely cream moisturizer. There is a light/lovely scent that goes away after a while, which I don’t mind because I think it’s divine. The cream is on the thicker size, so I use a pea size amount in the AM (face and neck) and double that amount at night. The consistency is whipped like and has a luxurious feel to it. My skin can seriously get so dry in the fall/winter months to the point where its flaky, tight and painful. This cream has been a life saver, I feel so hydrated all day when using this! "
235840447, On Enriched By Nature Cream ,Camille,No,35-44, I have comb/oily skin and this cream is extremely thick. There’s such a thing as over moisturizing that ends up not working too well on my skin and creates build up faster. Would pass on this if you’re an oily person. 
235840447, On Enriched By Nature Cream ,Karina D.,25-35,Combination,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
227383823, On Hyaluronic Acid Toner Plus ,Randito,Normal,18-24," I've bought this product about four or five times now, and I must say it has become a staple in my skincare routine! I currently have pretty normal skin, not too oily or too dry, but I try to focus on hydration because I like for my skin to look supple and maintain its youthfulness. This toner has helped with that A TON! Also, I'm vegan, so it's great that not only is this an amazing product, but also none of its ingredients are causing unnecessary harm or torture to animals! "
227383823, On Hyaluronic Acid Toner Plus ,Gogo,Normal,18-24, i've been using this twice a day for a few months now and it's pretty good! can't say i notice a huge difference in my skin but it does help w hydration i think 
227383823, On Hyaluronic Acid Toner Plus ,Karen R.,Combination,25-35, First time I used it it felt that it was hydrating my skin which felt nice. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and so far it feels like my skin is less dry despite the California summer heat. Definitely recommended. My skin is more on the dry side now /slight oily but back when I was living in Asia it was more on the oily side. I'm really happy with my purchase worth it. 
227383823, On Hyaluronic Acid Toner Plus ,Lulu,Dry,25-35,"Up until now, the toners that I have used always felt very dry or a bit hot and I thought that was normal (apparently not lol). I'm still trying a lot to eventually find products that work with my skin but for the toner I think this is the one! "
282431011, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Cream ,DD,Combination,25-35," I really wanted to love this moisturizer because it has some amazing ingredients, but something in it seems to be clogging my pores. I've tried switching out other products, but every time I use this multiple times in a row, I notice clogged pores. However, it's definitely gentle and hydrating and might work really well for others! There is a slight candy-like scent to it, but I found it to fade quickly so it didn't bother me. It's also has a gel-cream texture, which worked surprisingly well for my dry skin as the weather got colder. I don't regret giving this a shot, but I won't be repurchasing. "
282431011, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Cream ,Rebecca B.,Dry,18-24,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
282431011, On Dermalogy Cica Repair Snail Cream ,Nolan M.,Combination,25-35, all-rounded moisturizer that I would recommend to someone who has oily to normal skin type. Comapred to other snail moisturizers that have a more sticky feeling than yea ... this is an alternative. 
289369861, On Licorice pH Balancing Essential Cream ,Ling G.,Oily,25-35, Love this moisturizer. Been using it as a night cream since it doesn’t have spf. It’s light and hydrating. The first tube lasted half a year maybe and just got my second one. This time I’m pairing it with the serum in the same series for extra moisture in the winter. So far so good! 
289369861, On Licorice pH Balancing Essential Cream ,Cristina M.,Combination,45-55," I've used this cream in the past, but I like to try different products. I've come back because too many creams are gel creams and, while those are great at moisturizing, they tend to fill my pores. This one does not, gets absorbed easily, and isn't tacky. I guess it really is balanced. :) "
289369861, On Licorice pH Balancing Essential Cream ,francesdc012,Normal,25-35, Tried to use this as a night moisturizer and I love it! Doesn’t leave a sticky residue on my skin and I didn’t break out. It definitely left my skin looking bright in the morning. Will repurchase in the future! 
289369861, On Licorice pH Balancing Essential Cream ,Susan S.,Sensitive,25-35, Wow this was like trying to rub glue on my face. My hair kept sticking to my chin/cheeks and making me itchy. It did not moisturize enough and I found myself using several pumps per use. I had to return this. 
308904212, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Lip Plumper ,Huu N.,35-44, No," I was surprised by how much it tingled. I like the glossiness of the plumper but TBH, I thought I was purchasing just a lip gloss. But the added tingly is ok. "
308904212, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Lip Plumper ,Marinelle J., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, It completes my evening skin care routine! 
308904212, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Lip Plumper ,ndinelago c.,Other,35-44, definitely can feel the plump king effect! visually not sure if there’s a difference but i like the tingle and the moisturizing effect 
308904212, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Lip Plumper ,Brianna F.,18-24, No, Love this product than all the plumping products at Sephora. 
308904212, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Lip Plumper ,Lauren W., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, It plumps but leaves my lips feeling dried out when the product is wiped off. My lips began to flake and peel after 2 days of use. 😭 I think I would need to pair it with a separate lip balm for moisture. 
158422407, On Fresh Herb Origin Cream ,Panhia,Combination,35-44," Unfortunately, I was not too happy with this product. It was too oily and leaves a shiny residue on my face. I really wanted to like it, but will not be repurchasing again. "
158422407, On Fresh Herb Origin Cream ,Elle,Sensitive,35-44, I love this cream. It’s thick enough for my combination skin but isn’t too oily. I like the texture and the slight fragrance. I’ve purchased twice and will purchase again. It also isn’t irritating when my skin is sensitive after being outdoors. 
158422407, On Fresh Herb Origin Cream ,Dez,Combination,25-35," I purchased because of the great reviews but this is VERY oily. Be careful to bot use too much. I don't mind using on my neck and hands but it's a bit much, too oily for my skin. Would probably work well in cold dry areas, just use a little. "
158422407, On Fresh Herb Origin Cream ,Abigail,Combination,25-35," This product has a light, natural scent and doesn't irritate sensitive combination skin, which is great. But I have to second the observation someone else made in their review: it is SO shiny. It makes my face look and feel oily. It doesn't absorb as well as I'd expect. It might be ideal if they explicitly labeled this as a night cream. My rating reflects that I'm a tad disappointed because I hoped I could use it both night and day. "
158422407, On Fresh Herb Origin Cream ,Corrie1083,Combination,35-44,"That said, as a night cream, it works well. It's rich stuff without making me break out, despite that I'm somewhat prone to breakouts from moisturizers. I like the gentle, herby fragrance. "
212912621, On Agas ACue Cleansing Foam ,Elisabeth,Dry,Yes," I have dry skin and I did enjoy the feeling and smell of the product. Not overwhelming in my opinion. However, I still typically need a more moisturizing cleanser but this is nice when I am breaking out due to hormonal acne. I gifted it to my sister since she leans oily and she is a fan. "
212912621, On Agas ACue Cleansing Foam ,Jess,Yes,35-44," I have dry, sensitive skin and this cleanser has not irritated it or dried it out. It lathers up wonderfully and leaves me with a great base for the rest of my routine. "
212912621, On Agas ACue Cleansing Foam ,Alexandra N.,35-44,Dry," I received this product as complimentary. I have dry, sensitive, thin skin. I would not buy this for myself. However, for someone who has oily or acneic skin, this would probably be helpful. With this said, I did try it and found that it dried my skin. I did like the aroma. "
212912621, On Agas ACue Cleansing Foam ,sooya,Dry,Yes, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
238343628, On Resurfacing Sleep Mask ,Elizabeth C.,Normal,25-35," I am a huge fan of bakuchiol, and I like this mask. But it’s very runny, and I’ve noticed it’s not as moisturizing as I’d like it to be. I don’t know if I’ll repurchase it, but I’ll use the rest of the pot. "
238343628, On Resurfacing Sleep Mask ,Jenifer H.,Dry,45-55, This product didn’t really do anything for me- I don’t see any exfoliating results 
235840375, On Cleanse Me Softly Milk Cleanser ,JesSkin,Combination,No," This has been such a great milk cleanser for me during the start of the cold/winter season. My skin usually gets incredibly dry once there is any signs of the cold coming in and this has been such a great morning cleanser, soft, gentle, non irritating for my sensitive skin! As i've gotten older I've become sensitive to a lot of artifical/scents, but I found this line refreshing as the natural light scents are herbal/tea like and actually pleasant. I have the whole Sioris line, I use it for morning and night and it's been so gentle and super hydrating! I've been using it for over two weeks (even on the first day I felt the hydration instantly) and it really soothes a lot of the dry skin pains I would usually have in the morning after washing up. I can tell the difference on the days I'm lazy and don't use the Sioris line! I also break out easily when using new lines of skin care and seemed to especially with Korean cosmetics/skin care (IDK why and I get super sad about it bc I know Korean skincare lines are more advanced than US lines.) I'm just so happy Ive finally found something that works for me!! "
235840375, On Cleanse Me Softly Milk Cleanser ,Evelyn B.,No,35-44," Absolutely one of the best cleansers I've ever used! If not because I understand how skin routine works, I wouldn't be using moisturizers; it leaves my skin feeling so silky soft, bouncy, and still feels hydrated. I absolutely love it, so much so, I literally cannot imagine my routine without it anymore. I use it as its own in my am routine and match it up with a jelly-like cleanser for the pm routine. My skin has never been this soft and so healthy. Even my mom, who has super sensitive and dry skin nowadays, loves it. It works miracles! "
235840375, On Cleanse Me Softly Milk Cleanser ,Jona,18-24,Normal," I bought this cleanser as I really like milk cleansers as the first step of my skincare routine but this one has not wowed me. The pump gets stuck after one pump but you need more than one pump of product to really cleanse your face. My bottle has stayed mostly full because of this, I wish I would've returned it during the return window. I think there are probably more functional and beneficial milk cleansers out there. "
301806428, On V.Biome Advanced Eye Cream ,Emily,Combination,18-24, I for one do not have any sort of eye cream so trying this was very nice. The cream did not burn my eyes and actually really moistures my under eye which is a huge plus because I usually have really dry under eye on top of having dark circles. I tried it both with other products and Neogen products and it works great. Will definitely repurchase 
301806428, On V.Biome Advanced Eye Cream ,Elaine L.,Sensitive,18-24," This eye cream does indeed hydrate the skin and does not carry a scent. Great for folks with sensitive skin! Fragrance is just an incessant ingredient. However aside from them hydration, I did not find a significant improvement in wrinkles or dark circles. This may also be due to the fact it requires extended use though as I know these things take time. "
301806428, On V.Biome Advanced Eye Cream ,Siobhan S.,Dry,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
289142162, On Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3% ,Kate,Combination,25-35," I've been using this product since March 2022, and it remains to be my favorite cleanser. It's very gentle and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without being stripped. I love that it's free of sulfates, silicones, parabens, alcohol, fragrances, and certain essential oils that irritate my skin. I also love that its ingredients are minimal and that the featured ingredient, niacinamide, is listed high in the list of ingredients. Thank you SokoGlam for adding Naturium! "
289142162, On Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3% ,Ian Z.,Normal,25-35," It doesnt strip oil, it leaves me feeling clean and soft and results in no irritation, exactly what i want from a cleanser. "
289142162, On Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3% ,Bonnie G.,Combination,45-55," I’ve made a conscious effort to add Niacinamide to my routine, and I’m really loving this. It smells terrific, and foams up just enough, leaving my face soft and smooth. "
289142162, On Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3% ,Rayleigh,Oily,25-35," There's so much I LOVE about this cleanser! I have oily skin that is acne prone, along with very noticeable pores on my nose and cheeks (thanks genetics!!!). After only 3 days of using this cleanser, my skin is: glowing, excess oil has been reduced, my pores are less noticeable and my complexion is brighter than ever! This cleanser does not strip my skin and leaves it very hydrated/clean! My skin LOVES niacinamide and any discoloration I had has now been reduced! I was hesitant on trying Naturium products after the whole Susan Yara controversy, but this cleanser has changed my skin for the best! HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!! "
289142162, On Niacinamide Cleansing Gelée 3% ,Mardi08,Dry,25-35," I’ve been using this cleanser after trying so many different brands marketed for dry skin. I used to have a combination oily skin type but became dry since I got pregnant and even postpartum. This cleanser does not strip off natural moisture off my face but cleans very well. My husband who has oily skin type also uses this and works well for him, too. "
257582691, On Vitamin Tree Water Gel Cream ,Angelique H.,Combination,18-24, Very hydrating but it does leave a sticky film on your face for a couple of hours. I like to use it in the morning right when I wake up so that my skin isn't too dry when I put my sunscreen on. 
257582691, On Vitamin Tree Water Gel Cream ,Caitana H.,Combination,<18, I use this in the morning and it doesn’t make my oily t-zone worse while still hydrating my drier areas. It also hasn’t caused me to breakout or have any sort of redness so far 
257582691, On Vitamin Tree Water Gel Cream ,Rachel R.,Oily,25-35," I really like the consistency of this product, I've been using it day and night for like a month already, it gives a cool sensation and maintain my oily skin hydrated the whole day and night. "
257582691, On Vitamin Tree Water Gel Cream ,Kaylen C.,Oily,25-35, This gel feels nice and cooling but i do get oily quickly when i wear it so i only use it at night now. 
257582691, On Vitamin Tree Water Gel Cream ,SooJung P.,Dry,25-35, I have dry skin and need very rich or moisturizing creams. Unfortunately this one does not do it for me as my skin becomes dry later in the day. I noticed that any gel creams does not keep my face moisturized throughout the day. 
85375831, On White Truffle Intensive Ampoule ,Chey,Oily,25-35," Honestly, I'm not sure exactly what this targets, but it made my skin feel amazing. It was gentle with my oily skin and never made me break out or produce more oil. It made my skin feel like silk. There isn't a noticeable odor either. Great product, I would definitely repurchase it. "
85375831, On White Truffle Intensive Ampoule ,Ashley H.,Dry,25-35," After adding this product to my routine my skin looked and felt much better, I really enjoy this product "
85375831, On White Truffle Intensive Ampoule ,Hye L.,Normal,35-44, I had a high expectation about this product but unfortunately it broke me out. I stopped using it only after a few applications. Maybe need to use the remainder for my neck or body 
248634797, On Real Firming Bakuchiol Serum ,L,Normal,18-24," Great, gentle formula for getting into retinol. Has a higher percentage of bakuchiol than most other products on the market and still remains gentle. Saw a difference with each use, but wish the smell wasn’t as strong. "
248634797, On Real Firming Bakuchiol Serum ,Ren,Combination,25-35, I liked the way this felt on my skin but I didnt see any major difference it dark spots and fine lines. May need to use for a long period. 
248634797, On Real Firming Bakuchiol Serum ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," I use this probably twice a week because I wanted something a little more gentle on my skin that would make it feel more firm. It definitely worked, although not as good as the retinol I use. However, it is definitely more gentle and feels super soothing so would probably work well for people with sensitive skin. "
248634797, On Real Firming Bakuchiol Serum ,Anna N.,Combination,25-35," At the age of 30, it’s been really hard not to notice the little creases in my face. Was using this product religiously with no change at all. Great for maintaining skin. Hope it can work wonders for others. "
292938663, On Collagen Peptide Eye Cream ,Iris,Combination,<18, I’ve been using for a while. Brightened my dark circles a tad but seems like the results are temporary 
292938663, On Collagen Peptide Eye Cream ,Jessica F.,Combination,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
292938663, On Collagen Peptide Eye Cream ,Lauren,Combination,25-35," This is probably the biggest container of eye cream I've ever seen. Despite the size, the quality is unbeatable for the price.  "
225764022, On Azulene 147HA_Intensive Soothing Cream ,Deanna,Combination,25-35," I just finished a tube of this and it really helped sooth my irritated skin while adjusting to a tretinoin cream I've been using this year. The cream is very moisturizing, but not heavy and leaves my skin feeling protected when my skin barrier feels compromised. While the cream itself doesn't stand out, it integrated well with all of my skincare products and was a go-to product when I wanted a basic moisturizer at night. "
225764022, On Azulene 147HA_Intensive Soothing Cream ,Mo,Combination,25-35," I like this cream a lot after a peel or acid treatment, it’s very soothing and hydrating. Leave in overnight and skin is calm in the morning "
225764022, On Azulene 147HA_Intensive Soothing Cream ,Jo,Combination,18-24," I got this moisturizer as an add on to an order and I am in love. It actually helped calm and heal my skin after hormonal acne breakouts, plus is a great night time moisturizer. "
225764022, On Azulene 147HA_Intensive Soothing Cream ,Suzanne,Normal,35-44, This is really moisturizing and gentle. Love the smell too. 
225764022, On Azulene 147HA_Intensive Soothing Cream ,Jazzmine,Combination,25-35," I am 25 and have highly sensitive/combination skin. I love this stuff and I didn't think it would. I use it as a part of my night time routine and its like magic in an aluminum tube. My breakout is cleared up and my skin is smooth/moisturized. I was a little intimidated by the medicinal look/smell because I didn't want it to make my skin worse, but it proved me wrong. If you are on the fence, I would give it a shot "
226704331, On MadeCera Cream Mild Whipped Cleanser ,alyssa,Combination,25-35," I received this product purely by chance, and I have no regrets! I love the amount of slip and lather. I notice the smell may be vital for people sensitive to fragrance. I've used this foam cleanser without using a cleansing balm, and it removes stubborn makeup. I TRULY enjoyed this product, and you don't need a lot of products to cover your entire face. "
226704331, On MadeCera Cream Mild Whipped Cleanser ,Victoria G.,Sensitive,25-35," I really like the silky feel of this one, and I’m glad I read the reviews before use because yes, a little goes a long way. If you feel like it’s drying you out, try using a little less before giving up. I like the smell, it’s like a fresh out of the shower clean smell and it gives a nice lather. Most importantly, it doesn’t sting or irritate my sensitive skin at all! "
226704331, On MadeCera Cream Mild Whipped Cleanser ,athena,Combination,35-44," I had such an amazing experience with this cleanser. I initially got a trial size, then ordered a full size and then left my full size at a hotel while I was traveling. I use a tiny, tiny amount and I love it so much. The texture is creamy and as long as I use a tiny bit, it isn't drying at all. I also think it is a really good value considering you don't need a lot. I have very dry cheeks and oily t-zone so I start at my t-zone with my washing and then I use less on the dry area. "
226704331, On MadeCera Cream Mild Whipped Cleanser ,Amanda,Normal,25-35, I enjoy using this cleanser. A little goes such a long way. It helped get my makeup off completely after a long day of work. 
226704331, On MadeCera Cream Mild Whipped Cleanser ,Tamara,Combination,<18, I got this as a free item and tried it out. A little goes a long way! However it is a bit drying for my skin so I use this as a backup cleaner if I run out of my others ^^ 
161994550, On Water Wash Balm ,Jade F.,Combination,18-24, I've been using this for two years now and it's so great. I feel like it really cleanses my skin without taking away any mositure or irritating it 
161994550, On Water Wash Balm ,Sierra,Combination,25-35," I first received this product as a free gift. I used it initially as first part in double cleanse and then read it is supposed to be used as second step, water based cleanser. Either way this product is the best cleanser I have ever used. It has a distinct smell but I have learned to love it. It feels like I get the perfect clean, my skin is well prepped for moisturizing and it is never harsh. I love to use this with glycolic acid scrub from saturday skin and it has made wonders in how my skin feels. "
161994550, On Water Wash Balm ,Sensitive s.,Combination,35-44," I have used this product for almost a year now. I actually didn’t like it at first. The smell was strong and it felt a bit harsh. I was gonna give up on it, but I realized I could use it as a super gentle chemical exfoliator. I have sensitive skin, so this is great. Using it twice a day is way too much for me, but if I use it every other day, it’s perfect. "
161994550, On Water Wash Balm ,Asha,Sensitive,18-24,"The fruit acids do a good job of exfoliating. My skin is smooth afterwards. It does get rid of some dullness and brightens up my skin. I don’t need a strong exfoliator, so this is perfect if I use it consistently every 2-3 days. I don’t recommend it as a second step to the double cleans though. "
346833949, On Hydro-Stars ,CS,Oily,18-24, I am so happy with these patches! they are cute but really helped clear up a hormonal breakout fast 
208709554, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Essence ,Meenz,Combination,25-35," This essence is LIFE..I use this when I have a breakout or some redness/irritation. It's cooling and refreshing on the skin, and feels as light as water. It really helps soothe the irritated skin. On the pricier side but definitely worth every cent. "
208709554, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Essence ,Emily,Sensitive,18-24, Amazing! Feels so great! A little product goes a long way! 
208709554, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Essence ,Michelle W.,Combination,25-35," it pains me to write this review being that this is my first one star review regarding Korean skincare.I am a big advocate when it comes to KBeauty and i always convince my friends and family join the Kbeauty family.I purchased this essence when i was running low on the 'Then I Met You' essence,at first i had no idea what was causing me to breakout because i had purchased a couple of other items too.So i did the process of elimination and started using the new products with my holy grails and alas it turned out to be this essence i was actually very sad and i really wanted to like it now I'm left with an almost full bottle and i don't know what to do with. I would give it away but i don't want them to have the same reaction as me. "
186812752, On Egg Cream Mask Hydration Set (5 pack) ,Vanessa,Normal,25-35," This was not the product for me. The shape of the face mask is odd so there's not a way to put it on without getting serum in your eyes. The fumes alone burn my eyes pretty bad. The serum is nice and rich but given the shape of the sheet mask, I wish it was in a bottle to apply instead. "
186812752, On Egg Cream Mask Hydration Set (5 pack) ,Falena,Dry,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
186812752, On Egg Cream Mask Hydration Set (5 pack) ,Melissa,Normal,45-55, I like to use this mask at night. I use this as my last step after completing my night regimen. I like that my skins stays firm and moisturized until the following morning. 
238343680, On Turmeric Stick ,ns,Oily,25-35," does as advertised, really good "
238343680, On Turmeric Stick ,Molly,Dry,35-44," I agree with other reviewers that this stick mask definitely turns your face turmeric colored. That said, I used a gentle cleanser—two times—to wash off the mask and was good to go with no yellow residue.  "
238343680, On Turmeric Stick ,Pip,Combination,18-24,"As someone who studied Ayurveda, I appreciate the known efficacy of turmeric, and the stick does make the application less messy and stain-prone. So overall, I’m happy with the purchase, because I knew what I was getting into with turmeric. "
238343680, On Turmeric Stick ,Lily N.,Combination,25-35," It doesn't work fast, so multiple uses are needed. I DOES however keep you looking like you have patchy jaundice. i'm not a fan and regret the purchase, but hey, I use what I buy. Three stars. "
235840425, On Deep In A Barrier Cream ,archer l.,Combination,No," To the best of my knowledge this is one of only two moisturizers that utilize tamanu oil--the other being Krave (in the same price range when taking size into account). It appears all of the negative reviews are from those who did not do their research on this ingredient so be warned tamanu oil is a fairly heavy oil and has a distinct nutty scent (somewhat reminds me of maple syrup and since Sioris doesn't use artificial fragrances you will be smelling this oil) the main point of contention with all of the reviews under 4 stars aside from one which listed a nut allergy. It is an amazing ingredient that does wonders with skin discoloration, fine lines, dry skin, and a generally calming ingredient for the skin. What I like about this formulation in comparison to the Krave barrier cream is that it is lighter and so can be used in some cases during the day and the scent dissipates quicker as well (for me the scent dissipates usually within 10 minutes though I don't really mind it). And this saves me from having to purchase the oil separately and trying to mix with a separate moisturizer. The sole reason to purchase this product is for the formulation with tamanu oil. If that's not an ingredient you are looking for then there are probably better products for you. If the scent of tamanu oil doesn't bother you are you're looking for all the benefits this ingredient offers then I highly recommend this formulation with the other great ingredients offered and a much lighter experience than straight tamanu oil. If the scent is something you are worried about, tamanu oil is sold as an oil in many health supplement stores for around $10 so I'd highly recommend testing it out there before trying this out. "
235840425, On Deep In A Barrier Cream ,Nozi,No,25-35, Fantastic night cream and I like the small but more important that my skin loves it. 
235840425, On Deep In A Barrier Cream ,Kristen,35-44,Normal,I am so happy that I bought this cream)))) 
235840425, On Deep In A Barrier Cream ,Heather,Combination,No," I cannot put this on my face without gagging. It smells so bad. I’ve never had a problem with smells before, but this just makes me want to puke. I don’t know how well it works because I cannot get past the horrible stench. "
301806376, On V.Biome Infusion Serum ,Amanda,Combination,25-35, I love this Vitamin C serum. It kept my skin hydrated and bright during the winter. Cannot wait to purchase this again. 
301806376, On V.Biome Infusion Serum ,Chloe,Normal,18-24," I love the texture of this serum and how it made my skin feel. It is super silky and is really enjoyable to put on. I'm not sure if it has had any long term or super drastic effects after finishing a bottle, but it gives a great glow to the skin. It also looks great under any makeup! "
301806376, On V.Biome Infusion Serum ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," Definitely noticed some brightening and hydrating effects of this serum, but not so much on skin elasticity. It is pretty good and I will probably get through the whole bottle, but didn't have the most visible effects. "
320422043, On Clean Lotus Water Calming Sheet Mask ,Jennifer C.,Combination,45-55, Absolutely fabulous sheet masks. They fit perfectly and work incredibly well. This is great after being blasted with cold air in winter time. It helps keep the skin moisturized and hydrated while keeping fine lines at bay. 
320422043, On Clean Lotus Water Calming Sheet Mask ,Olivia L.,Combination,25-35, Love this face mask. Very hydrating and left me with an amazing glow! Would definitely purchase more next time! 
320422043, On Clean Lotus Water Calming Sheet Mask ,R,Combination,<18, My combo skin absorbed it so well and after putting on moisturiser to lock the masks benefits i woke up with the softest skin ever. 
320422043, On Clean Lotus Water Calming Sheet Mask ,Allison R.,Combination,25-35," I like to try a new sheet mask every time I place an order - and as usual, this sheet mask is great! I haven't tried one I haven't liked fro Soko Glam. I really gravitate towards the sheet masks that don't have so much fragrance, mineral oil, and in general are hydrating and very gentle - a really good one to try for dehydrated skin this winter! "
320422043, On Clean Lotus Water Calming Sheet Mask ,sarah,Combination,35-44," Je le recommande, il est facile à utiliser, il est adapté aux peaux sensibles, la peaux est douce et hydratée ! "
346834913, On Superhue ,SHERMINI S.,Medium,Balanced," I LOVE this product! and have gifted it to several friends. With consistent use it's really improved my hyperpigmentation. I also use it as a spot treatment over areas of inflammation, acne and have found it helps resolve irritation very quickly. "
346834913, On Superhue ,geetika,Medium,Combination, this serum has been a skin care game changer for me! it's really brightened and evened out my skin. it's nourishing and easy to use as well! 
346834913, On Superhue ,Jayna F.,Light,Sensitive," I am pale with hyperpigmentation and rosacea on my cheeks, I saw almost immediate results in a few days. After a few weeks I’m really pleased. It has not completely removed the saturated areas but they are much less noticeable. My (sensitive) skin feels great! "
346834913, On Superhue ,Heena c.,Medium,Combination, This is a statement in my skincare. 
346834913, On Superhue ,Tracy J.,Dry,55+, I love it 
301806146, On V.Biome Firming Cream ,Trang P.,Combination,25-35," The moisturizer I would say is good for autumn. For the winter, you might need some extra layers (ie. Essence etc). The jar is more on the tall cylinder side. It has an interesting stick to grab the moisturizer but it's harder to grab enough in one go. (Or maybe I am supposed to use my fingers and use the stick when the cream is running low). "
301806146, On V.Biome Firming Cream ,Emily,Dry,25-35," Great product! I live in a desert, work in a kitchen and have dry skin and this moisturizer saved my skin. I noticed a difference right away and continued to notice a difference until the end of the container. I will definitely order again. "
301806146, On V.Biome Firming Cream ,Patrisha P.,Dry,55+," Been using this for 3 weeks, haven't seen any changes. It actually seems to be very drying  "
188970320, On SoonJung Lip & Eye Makeup Remover ,Amanda,Normal,25-35, The makeup remover stings my eyes when I accidently get it in my eyes while taking off mascara and eyeliner. Works for the rest of my makeup. I think its a good step before cleansing. 
188970320, On SoonJung Lip & Eye Makeup Remover ,taryn,Dry,<18, i do regret buying this but it didn’t irritate my skin which i appreciated didn’t dry it out which was cool but it didn’t take my makeup all the way off pretty disappointed about that. 
188970320, On SoonJung Lip & Eye Makeup Remover ,Gina,Combination,35-44,We're so sorry to hear that this product didn't work out for you. Please reach out to us at 
231509649, On VITALIFT-A Forte ,T Y.,Combination,No," This product is good for acne and various irregularities on face but against fine wrinkles or stronger, this product is useless. Tretinoin 0.5% is much better choice. "
231509649, On VITALIFT-A Forte ,Jennifer G.,No,45-55,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you.  "
226473866, On All Filter Mask Zone Mist ,iceberri99,Dry,35-44," Just got the product so can't speak for efficacy yet but the spray is awful. It's not a fine mist like face sprays should be, it sprays a lot very unevenly so I have to pour the product into a better spray bottle. Please fix. "

247390523, On Surmedic+ Perfection 100tm All In One Facial Eyecream ,Shirley L.,Combination,25-35, I bought it but I haven't use it yet but base on my friend recommendation she said it works wonder. 
247390523, On Surmedic+ Perfection 100tm All In One Facial Eyecream ,Jade,Combination,35-44," This is my new favorite eye cream. I mostly use it at night as it is a little thicker than my others (Saturday Skin), but I absolutely love this product. It's incredibly hydrating. I recommend everyone add this cream to your routine! "
247390523, On Surmedic+ Perfection 100tm All In One Facial Eyecream ,Erin H.,Sensitive,25-35," Love this eye cream that can be applied to entire face! It has a nice, buttery texture which is applied to the skin easily and feel that my skin gets firmer and brighter after applying for a few days! LOVE this!!!! "
247390523, On Surmedic+ Perfection 100tm All In One Facial Eyecream ,Iris H.,Dry,>55," This is a nice cream for around eyes and is very moisturizing, however, I felt it sting a little by my crows feet. I’m usually sensitive in that area, so was hoping this eye cream wouldn’t sting, however it’s not bad enough to stop using it. "
236159028, On Honey Serum ,Ashleigh,Combination,25-35," I layer this serum into my routine when I have some rosacea starting to show and it eliminates it pretty quickly. Super moisturizing, nice texture. "
236159028, On Honey Serum ,Lindsay,Sensitive,35-44," I like this serum ok. I am in my late 30's with rosacea and opted for this serum for it's anti-inflammatory properties. It comes out silky and is thick for a serum, but not overly so. A single pump easily coats face, neck and decollete. It feels almost like a smooth jelly as you apply it, but it dries down very sticky. Unfortunately, putting a moisturizer on top doesn't help with the stickiness much. It's great for a no-makeup day and does give skin a nice healthy glow and it has helped with my redness, so there's that. Pros: light natural fragrance, rich texture upon application, nice glide over skin, a little goes a long way. Cons: Leaves skin sticky at finish, doesn't go away with layering of a moisturizer on top. "
236159028, On Honey Serum ,Neha B.,Combination,18-24," i love this serum so much, i've only been using it for a few days at night. When I use it, my skin looks so radiant in the morning. It's a very thick consistency which I appreciated. I use my gua sha right after applying this and it works great ! "
236159028, On Honey Serum ,Grecia S.,Combination,25-35," I've never tried another product with such a texture before, but after I tried it I can't be without it. It glides on silk-like and feels a bit like velvet on the skin, very nourishing, and it sits like a film that protect the skin. Since being in AC all day everyday I had been looking for products to keep the moisture in my skin locked in and this one hit the mark, I even feel it performs better than some creams and moisturizers I've tried thus far. I most definitely burned through the first bottle and just purchased the second. The amazing glass skin dewy look is an added plus. I really feel amazing when I use this product. "
236159028, On Honey Serum ,JT,Combination,25-35," I'm not a fan. I wanted to love it because of the reviews. I have combination skin (extremely dry everywhere but the T-Zone). I applied the serum only on the dry areas of my face, it did nothing (positive) for my skin, and I started to break out. The texture is a thick gel-like consistency; too think for a serum IMO. Just like some of the previous reviewers stated, the serum doesn't absorb well into the skin, and it just sits on top like a slippery substance. I don't like the smell of it either - it has this lingering plastic smell. I don't recommend and will not be purchasing this again. "
140973541, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Green Ampoule ,Lauren S.,Combination,25-35," This is a great product. If I had never tried the p:rem safe me cream, I would probably give this a 4.5/5. This is a nice product, very hydrating, but feels slightly sensitizing for some reason that I can't put my finger on. Overall nice but the cream is my all time favorite. "
140973541, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Green Ampoule ,Rachel,Combination,25-35," I do not breakout easily unless it's my time of the month. This serum made my face absolutely explode with deep, painful breakouts. This serum even caused my cheeks to break out which is never a problem area for me. I am confident that this is the culprit because it was the only new product I added. I am disappointed too because I did feel like it was very hydrating! "
140973541, On Safe Me. Relief Moisture Green Ampoule ,Ela,Combination,25-35,I'm very sorry to hear that this product did not work out for you! Our team is happy to provide further assistance! Please kindly email us at 
408180723, On Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner ,StayK,Combination,45-55," I 1st read about this toner when it was still hard to find. A few months later, a sample of it appeared in 1 of my subscription boxes. And I fell in love. I love that it's a slight more viscous of what u may think of as a toner, but its still thinner than a serum. Its just lovely & nourishing & fragrance-free & that perfect hydrating step. Some AM's, I've only applied this, then SPF, and I am good! I love its versatility, ability to absorb, hydrate and it's fragrance-free & doesn't bother my acne & sensitivity. "
408180723, On Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner ,Sheila,Combination,18-24," This toner is truly a game-changer to my whole routine. Since I have been using it, the product has been really gentle with my acne-prone skin. I have a habit of not doing a patch test on my skin, though I'm glad to report that nothing negative came out of it! "
408180723, On Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner ,Jamie B.,Dry,35-44,"Sad to say that my bottle is about to run empty, but I look forward to restocking it. "
408180723, On Black Rice Hyaluronic Toner ,Giaa,Normal,45-55, This is my favorite toner. I am on my third bottle. It has the best skin-loving ingredients and is the perfect start to my skin care routine. I put it in the palm of my hand and press it into my face and neck. It preps my skin for everything I put on after. Definitely will continue to purchase this toner. I will not let myself run out. 
428421516, On The Retinol 0.1 Cream ,Cindy C.,Sensitive,35-44, Getting a late start in the wrinkle game but I figure why not. I do really well with this brand so I gave it a try and it's a winner. I've notice the subtle changes with no disruption to my routine. I've already order another. 
428421516, On The Retinol 0.1 Cream ,Betty,Normal,25-35, Been using this for a couple of weeks now and haven’t noticed any difference. My skin did become sensitive after using this and I’ve used retinol before. 
428421516, On The Retinol 0.1 Cream ,Amy R.,Dry,25-35,We are so sorry to hear this product did not work out for you. Please reach out to us via e-mail with your order number and we'll be happy to get you all sorted! 
444407255, On Bio-Lipid Restoring Body Lotion ,alyssa,Sensitive,25-35," I'll be honest, I tried the lip product from Naturium, and I had high hopes I'd like this product. Yet, I found my skin not feeling hydrated when applied. I would use it after coming out of the shower, and it would take vigorous strokes, rubbing it into my skin. It did not absorb into my skin as I'd hoped. I did however, I tried the Klair body and loved that, even though it is a bit more expensive. My skin actually increased in dryness. I opt to use natural shea butter instead. "
444407255, On Bio-Lipid Restoring Body Lotion ,Elizabeth C.,Combination,55+,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
444407255, On Bio-Lipid Restoring Body Lotion ,Jen,Dry,18-24, My hands are very dry and I've been on a years long quest trying to find a moisturizer that would hydrate my hands for a decent amount of time without feeling greasy or with any perfumes. This baby is IT! I love it so much. So rich and thick but not greasy and doesn't smell like anything. Nice big bottle. I will always buys this. PLEASE do not stop making this... 
228433330, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ye (Vitality) ,Sophie,Dry,25-35," This is an incredible serum and for the price, it can't be beat. I use it in the morning with my vitamin C serum and at night with my honey serum. I feel like it adds to the effect of each. My skin looks more youthful and has more of a glow ever since I started using it. I will definitely repurchase - and now I want to try all of their serums! "
228433330, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ye (Vitality) ,Chichi23,Dry,25-35," I use this every night and it makes my skin super soft and supple the next morning! It sinks in my skin well and it didn’t cause any irritation. I love that in contains natural ingredients without alcohol, mineral oils, essential oils, or silicone. I definitely buy this in the future! It’s skin use gifted me this product! "
228433330, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ye (Vitality) ,Aimz531,Combination,45-55," Moisturizing Serum helps to soothe irritated skin with Ginkgo Leaf water and Tremella mushrooms. The serum uses fermented yeast extract, which is a highly effective ingredient for moisture. The downfall for me was the citrus scent other than that this is a true gem. "
228433330, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ye (Vitality) ,Jasmine,Dry,25-35," I was gifted this serum to try, and I really enjoy it. I have dry skin, so I like a serum that hydrates & gives a glow! This serum was super hydrating and made my skin feel plump and gave it a nice glow. I also love the bit of citrus scent to it! Definitely a winner to me! "
228433330, On It's Skin Power 10 Formula - Ye (Vitality) ,laurisloves,Combination,25-35," It really revitalize the skin, make it feel more firm and bright, the formula gets absorbed easily and doesn't feel sticky like others. I also love that I can use it combineb with the Li serum, and that I can layer it up with my other Moisturizerrs and my makeup without problems. "
80333124, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Emulsion ,Helen K.,Combination,35-44," I was hesitant to switch lotions as I had one that worked okay, but was a tad greasy. After lots of research on Soko Glam, decided to try the Dewytree emulsion lotion. Love that you don't need a lot of this product, it doesn't feel greasy, doesn't cause breakouts, and leaves my skin with a dewy look/feel which I have never been able to achieve before. Still a work in progress, but this lotion helps a lot along with the whole routine.  "
80333124, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Emulsion ,Melissa D.,Combination,45-55,"Perfect for combo skin. I do not have increased breakouts with this lotion, feels lightweight, works great under sunscreen and makeup (when I wear it). Also works well with sensitive skin and dry patches. I've never had redness with this product, and on a recent trip I really missed using this! The bottle is nice, stores easily and only pumps out enough lotion for your needs so you aren't wasting any product. As I always say...wish there was a travel size option available but I'll be repacking this one into a tinier bottle in the future if I ever need to do so. "
80333124, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Emulsion ,Elizabeth L.,Combination,25-35,"Product is more expensive, however the bottle is 5 oz and like I said above, you don't need a lot so I can see this lasting a long time. Also ideal for desert climate, however, I would use this in any climate with my skin for such positive results. "
448692419, On Daily Protectant Facial Mist ,Olivia,Normal,25-35," The spray is a little heavy. It is no mist. I love the sleek bottle and it’s travel size friendly! I’m a huge fan of mists just for that extra touch of hydration and this one is good. It is lightweight and refreshing. It doesn’t add a lot of moisture and it doesn’t do any miracle work, but it’s perfect for a quick refresh! Definitely in my top 5 skincare mists that I grab for lately. "
448692419, On Daily Protectant Facial Mist ,Belkys R.,Combination,45-55," When I wake up and I feel my face skin dehydrated, this is my option with any doubt. "
448692419, On Daily Protectant Facial Mist ,Laura N.,Dry,18-24, This is my first step to preparing my face for makeup and I use the mist to hydrate my face. It does feel refreshing and doing these routine has made my makeup look nice. 
448692419, On Daily Protectant Facial Mist ,Pacth,Dry,35-44, I loved the attractive packaging and size of the bottle in hand. The spray was just okay though so price seems fair. It gives a refreshing spray but not very much added benefits after that I felt. 
448692419, On Daily Protectant Facial Mist ,Jasmine M.,Oily,25-35," As the winter weather rolls in, I needed extra moisture while also keeping the application process fast and easy as possible. This checks both of those boxes. I love having this available during and between classes, after showers, and throughout the day. It helps to add an extra layer of hydration while also keeping my face clean. Who doesn't like a facial spray? "
255648290, On Galac Niacin 2.0 Essence ,sooj,Oily,No," Gave three stars because it didn’t have a scent and absorbed really well. Unfortunately my skin didn’t like this. After trying this for a week, my skin looked terrible. It looked irritated, dry, and my already big pores looked more visible. "
255648290, On Galac Niacin 2.0 Essence ,Rosemary B.,No,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
218603166, On Pear Mint Food Mask ,MichS,Combination,25-35," This product I think works well on skin that does not get irritated easily. I have combination and sensitive skin so I found this mask to be too harsh for me personally, it makes my skin red and burns a bit. It is too bad because it smells amazing and i like the texture a lot. I think this would be great for someone else, just not for me ! "
218603166, On Pear Mint Food Mask ,Makaela,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
218603166, On Pear Mint Food Mask ,elaine,Combination,35-44, I think this product matches dry skin. it was too rich for my skin (I have acne skin) 
238343668, On Mymatcha All-Over Moisture Stick ,Holly,Dry,35-44," I love the convenience of a hydration stick, but this one doesn't quite meet my standards. Since it's only coconut oil, matcha and beeswax, the consistency changes drastically in cold weather. And I'm just talking inside my house during winter, not taking it with me outside! My guess is that the coconut oil becomes a solid, thus changing the silky smooth feel to a lumpy bumpy one. I still use it before bed, but it's not my go-to. "
238343668, On Mymatcha All-Over Moisture Stick ,Tina W.,Normal,>55," I’ve been using as a nighttime lip balm, just tap it on and lips stay hydrated all night still slick in the am, thick, would be a bit hesitant to use on my face, I’m a water gel kinda gal, the convenience of a stick hydration sold me after using a serum stick, no mess and easy use, would be good for cuticle care by bedside "
238343668, On Mymatcha All-Over Moisture Stick ,Nichole B.,Dry,25-35," I use this during the day and sometimes at night on my t zone, and it has calmed redness in those areas. It has taken some time for this to work (about a few days of consistent application), but it is good. "
238343668, On Mymatcha All-Over Moisture Stick ,Claire,Combination,<18, After using it for nearly a year I absolutely love this moisture stick as a lip balm. Whenever my lips are dry this is my go-to and I never need to reapply it multiple times as it leaves a very thick layer. I would not recommend using this as a moisturizer as it is very thick and isn't the best for oily skin. 
238343668, On Mymatcha All-Over Moisture Stick ,Lulu,Combination,18-24," It feels and smells nice, but honestly once you get over the “wow this is so convenient and cute” aspect of it, you’ll notice that it’s not all that moisturizing. I only used it a few times on my lips and my elbows and it felt like it was actually drying them out? My elbows even developed some sort of rash that lasted like a week. Didn’t work for me at all unfortunately. "
278682048, On ACV Vinegar Treatment ,Linda L.,Dry,35-44, Smells great. This really moisturized smf softened my hair exponentially just after one use! Would purchase again. 
278682048, On ACV Vinegar Treatment ,Briony,Combination,35-44," The first time I tried this I couldn’t really tell a difference, but I used it a second time two days later and was shocked by the transformation. I have dry curly hair, and it was softer, shinier, less frizzy, with more defined curls. I used it again with the same result. By then I was running low so I decided to save it for a special occasion. Used it again after 2 months and again no big difference but after using it again the next day I had shampoo commercial hair. Concluded that it takes a couple of tries to take full effect, but worth it once it does. Recommend buying two bottles "
278682048, On ACV Vinegar Treatment ,DAR,25-35,25-35, I have hair that's quick to both take in moisture and lose it. Have used this a few times and it's nice but I can't say I notice a significant difference from my usual routine. 
278682048, On ACV Vinegar Treatment ,Cindy Z.,Dry,18-24, This product does its job very well! Makes my hair feel hydrated and it drys straight with no frizz! 
278682048, On ACV Vinegar Treatment ,S.S,Combination,18-24, Loves how my hair feels after using it 
248355163, On Green Tangerine Vita C Cleansing Foam ,sarazaidi,Sensitive,18-24," it has vitamin c which i was skeptical about since i have very sensitive skin, but its so gentle. i use to use the belief one but this one is just as good and its more affordable too! i use this when I'm double cleansing "
248355163, On Green Tangerine Vita C Cleansing Foam ,Nantana R.,Combination,45-55, Clean my face so well! It is light and creamy. 
248355163, On Green Tangerine Vita C Cleansing Foam ,Jaclyn,Oily,25-35," I have fairly oily skin and my skin has never felt stripped before this product. I will say, a little goes a long way. It lathers amazingly and smells great. My only problem is that after I wash it off, my skin feels so dry and sad. Really wanted to love it but I probably won't repurchase again. "
188811793, On Saccharomy Brightening Star Mask ,K.K.,Combination,45-55, I bought 3 and I should've purchased more! I feel brighter and more plump after using these. 
188811793, On Saccharomy Brightening Star Mask ,Raynel,Dry,25-35, I really loved this mask! I’m anxiously awaiting its return to stock! I’ll need to purchase an extra amount next time to make sure I don’t ever run out of it again. 
188811793, On Saccharomy Brightening Star Mask ,Patricia,Combination,25-35, Loved trying this mask. My skin felt healed and soft. Glowed the entire day and the following one as well. 
188811793, On Saccharomy Brightening Star Mask ,Dilcia R.,Normal,18-24, Havent noticed any dramatic change for my skin but it feels good on my skin and will continue to keep using 
444407387, On The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash ,Samantha,Sensitive,18-24," I have seen this brand at Target but decided to order it here. This brand and this product I am completely obsessed with. After using this body wash, I was shocked at how smooth my skin was, even after a few hours, my skin felt great. "
444407387, On The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash ,Fatima C.,Combination,25-35, I love to wash my underarms with this cleanse. The odor under my arms goes away immediately. 
444407387, On The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash ,Mozett C.,Oily,18-24, I love this! it's perfect for when you need to chemically exfoliate your body and leaves your skin soft! 
444407387, On The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash ,Shaun,Dry,25-35," I tried this out as I have recently been using a leave on glycolic acid product on my body and loved the results but it did leave my skin a little sensitised at times. But moving to this instead has been a perfect swap. It leaves my body feeling so flawlessly soft and supple, lathers nicely but not stripping and love the pump bottle. "
444407387, On The Smoother Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Body Wash ,hillary,Oily,25-35," This is a nice body wash. It lathers well and I love the exfoliating value from the glycolic acid. It has helped prevent ingrown hairs! It is fragrance free (free from masking fragrances as well) so the scent is extremely chemically- smells like plastic, slightly unpleasant but a good option if you prefer fragrance free body products! "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," I bought this brush because I really like the British M line and I figured I would give it a try. I have fine hair but a lot of it, so needless to say my hair gets tangled easily. This brush is amazing. Super gentle, doesn’t pull so less hair comes out while brushing. Gets tangled out easily and is super easy to clean. Definitely my favorite brush I have owned. "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Jean C.,Combination,18-24," I saw this brush on SOKO GLAM and thought I'd give it a go as my last brush was on it's last legs. So far no complaints! It does the job and it's quite a nice brush overall. Excellent for cleaning the brush too as it's got holes in the brush and isn't a paddle brush. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't feel it was as strong as my old brush. It takes a few tries to get through tangles compared to before, but I think it's due to this brush being slimmer than my old one. I have very thick hair which doesn't help! But I'm happy with this one, it seems cleaner and sleeker in style and is high quality so I'm sure it'll last a long time. "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,neil,Dry,25-35," Bought this as a last minute add to cart for my mom. She ended up loving it so much, that I bought it for my sister. Such a great brush!! "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,girley,45-55,45-55," I felt my hair is hopeless, that is why even if this brush is expensive I still bought + after reading good reviews. My problem really is after shower my hair is all tangled up and every time I brush it, hair fall is crazy, but when I use it...lo and behold!!! What?!!! It detangles my hair, no bother and super less hair fall. I don't know the science about it but is surely works!!! "
247391711, On Clean Forever Young Biome Ampoule ,sarah,Combination,35-44, Je recommande ce sérum ! La texture pénétre rapidement sans effet gras ni collant. La pipette est très pratique à utiliser. Il est adapté aux peaux sensibles. La peau est plus éclatante et nourrie. 
247391711, On Clean Forever Young Biome Ampoule ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," This has definitely made it into my daily routine. I was a little skeptical at first because the texture is a little odd and thick. But it absorbs very well and leaves the skin feeling hydrated but not sticky. Instantly I noticed my skin was calmer, hydrated and more firm. Additionally, I noticed that some dry spots on my face pretty much went away instantly. Couldn’t recommend more. "
247391711, On Clean Forever Young Biome Ampoule ,Janet M.,Normal,25-35," I am new to rover in, in fact I had never heard of it. Frankly, I think they have some of the best products out there. I had persistent eczema on my ear and using Rovectin products has completely eliminated it. The bombe is like a serum, I use it like one. There is absolutely no smell and it absorbs easily in the skin. Together with the cream my skin is very smooth and looks great. And the price is right too. Everything is so superior to the expensive products that I have been using from another high end brand. Finally, great skin and yet no greasy feel. "
229194122, On The Little Book of Jeong ,Alma S.,Combination,18-24, Impressive 
229194122, On The Little Book of Jeong ,Taylor B.,Oily,55+," My partner and I are both mixed race (he is mixed with Korean and I am mixed with black) and both of us often find ourselves feeling disconnected from our cultures. I got this book to read together and help us look into our relations, as well as developing more empathy for others. This book has also helped us learn more about his culture. I am really appreciative of that and being able to use this book to learn new things and bond with my partner. It’s greatly written and leaves you feeling positive and hopeful in a world that often leaves you disheartened. Thanks Charlotte Cho! "
229194122, On The Little Book of Jeong ,Cherie M.,Oily,35-44, A little heartwarming read that I enjoyed so much that I decided to get another one to gift to a friend. 
49228997, On Squeeze Green Watery Toner ,Leora,Combination,18-24," This toner has provided me with the hydration my skin always craves during the winter months. I use it after cleansing, and my skin always feels super soft, plump, and hydrated. I’ve also noticed slight improvements in my overall skin tone. Someone even complimented me that my skin looked really clear a few days ago, and I had thought it wasn’t doing much at first. Previous toners I’d used always felt drying, but this is the exact opposite. "
49228997, On Squeeze Green Watery Toner ,Hailee C.,Oily,25-35," I truly feel like this toner saved my skin barrier. Since I started using it I cannot even put into words the difference it’s made in my skin. My redness is gone, I feel like some of my acne hyperpigmentation is fading, and when I wake up in the morning my skin feels normal instead of slick and greasy. A miracle in a bottle! "
49228997, On Squeeze Green Watery Toner ,Hannah,Oily,18-24, I love this toner! I think it smells so good and I like the watery consistency. I feel like my skin is clearer and refreshed. Great for other people with oily skin! 
49228997, On Squeeze Green Watery Toner ,Cassel N.,Combination,18-24, It smells so good and even leaves my skin feeling hydrated after I use it! Unlike other toners I've used in the past that were way too harsh. Its one of my favorite steps in my facial routine. 
49228997, On Squeeze Green Watery Toner ,Kristi,Combination,25-35," This is a great toner for my combination skin. I feel like it evens out my oily areas while still hydrating the drier sections of my face. It seems to help prevent oil buildup throughout the day as well. I can't say if it's helped with my acne/scarring because I'm using it in combination with so many other products, but it hasn't made it any worse. It smells like alcohol, which can be a turn off to some, but it dissipates pretty quickly. "
447565696, On Tea Time Deep Moisture Hydrogel Mask (Single) ,Olivia L.,Dry,25-35," This was very soothing, did not irritate my skin and left it feeling hydrated. A little pricey per mask per use but I would definitely repurchase again in the future as a treat "
447565696, On Tea Time Deep Moisture Hydrogel Mask (Single) ,Blake,Sensitive,18-24," I got this in the lucky red envelope for free and will definitely be purchasing more. Left my skin feeling soft and hydrated after using it, didn’t irritate my sensitive skin at all "
447565696, On Tea Time Deep Moisture Hydrogel Mask (Single) ,Kelley,Sensitive,25-35," I got this mask as a free gift so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was very soothing on my irritated skin (I also put it in the fridge beforehand) and my skin looked much better after. "
447565696, On Tea Time Deep Moisture Hydrogel Mask (Single) ,Heidi,Combination,55+," This sheet face mask is amazing! First of all it’s thicker and more substantial than most sheet masks (that are goopy and like trying to stick tissue paper to your face); so easy to put on and it stays in place! No excess drippy product, either. All the ingredients are contained in the gel type mask. Also the mask is in two parts - tops of the face to the nose and a separate part for around the mouth and chin. Super easy to apply! "
240928532, On Hypoallergenic Cica Gauze Pad ,Tatiana P.,Combination,18-24, Honest and true this product has saved my skin so many times. I wear a mask for long periods of time at work and am in the sun for most of the day. This product not only calms any maskne I get but also delivers much needed hydration back to my skin. This looks like it will become a holy grail in my skin routine 
240928532, On Hypoallergenic Cica Gauze Pad ,Beth F.,Dry,55+, When I first used the Cica Recue Gauze Pad I didn't notice a difference. Went to bed and when I got up my face felt so smooth. It even helped where a pimple was thinking of forming and it shut it down. I have a little bit of discoloration on the side of my face and it seems to be a bit lighter. The only question I have is this something you can use daily? I do enjoy using it and having my skin feel so smooth. Thank you! 
240928532, On Hypoallergenic Cica Gauze Pad ,Tatiana P.,Combination,18-24, Lately I’ve been breaking out around my mouth from wearing a mask for 8+ hours a day at work and this has saved my life. It delivers almost instant relief from redness and irritation. I normally use this in the night after work to help calm my sensitive dry combo skin. By the morning the pimples are much less red and my face doesn’t hurt. I definitely recommend anyone getting this product. Will for sure repurchase in the future 
231710630, On Wash All Barrier Relief Cleanser ,maya,Dry,18-24," I purchased this months ago and after using it every night and nearly every morning there’s still so much left in the bottle! A little goes such a long way if you lather it with water. When I feel like I need a deeper cleanse, I’ll use more and rub the oil in before lathering. It never dries my skin out, has a subtle, clean scent that I honestly love, and the packaging is great - you don’t have to worry about squeezing out too much accidentally!  "
231710630, On Wash All Barrier Relief Cleanser ,Maria C.,Combination,45-55,"I figured this’d be a one-off purchase due how much you get for the price, but with how long a bottle lasts and how consistently clear my skin has been I see myself purchasing this again and again. "
231710630, On Wash All Barrier Relief Cleanser ,Nicole,Sensitive,25-35, Love this cleanser! It works so well to take off all my makeup - including my mascara! Love how it turns from an oil to a bubbly cleanser with water. Leaves my face super clean but not stripped of moisture 
231710630, On Wash All Barrier Relief Cleanser ,Chantal D.,Combination,25-35," I haven't cared about a facial cleanser this much since the sum:37 miracle rose cleansing stick. (RIP to a great one. It was discontinued five years ago and I'm still in mourning.) Every other cleanser has just been... there. Fine. I'd notice a bad one, but never found any that were particularly good. Until this one. I love the way my skin feels after using this. It's noticeable every single time. It feels clean and smooth and soft without feeling like there's residue left behind. I love the bottle. It's easy to dispense and allows for more control than a pump. I also just really like the aesthetic of this plain grey bottle for reasons that I don't entirely understand. "
428420838, On The Niacinamide 15 Serum ,Ally,Combination,25-35, Bought this for my boyfriend’s blemish-prone skin. I’ve noticed an improvement in both his blemishes and texture. Will definitely be repurchasing! 
428420838, On The Niacinamide 15 Serum ,Yang,Combination,35-44, I can only use this sparingly on my t zone areas as I noticed over time that this tends to dry out my skin. Will not repurchase. I have normal combo sensitive skin for reference. 
222882228, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pad ,Jane S.,Combination,18-24, I use it as my first step in the morning. One pad is enough for my whole face and neck. Good value! I pat it down and it feels hydrating and soothing. 
222882228, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pad ,Ryan G.,Sensitive,18-24," been using this for about two weeks and so far so good! I have super sensitive and dehydrated skin and my toner I was using before this was super hydrating but burned the sh** out of my face. This toner feels so good and has noticeably reduced redness, acne scars, and acne itself. only reason I put four starts is because its not as hydrating as I’d like but my skin is pretty severe so I still love it ! "
222882228, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pad ,Naila,Combination,35-44," I have sensitive skin and need a toner that can be easily carried around during travel, so I chose to give this a try. It turned out very well. My skin is visibly getting smooth and more hydrated comparing when using traditional toners. Will purchase again. "
222882228, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pad ,Monii H.,Combination,18-24, I bought this because I’ve always wanted to try toner pads after seeing Korean skincare YouTubers use them and luckily this was one sale during Lunar New Year so I bought it. I love it! I have some redness on my cheeks so I left the toner pads as like a mask on my cheeks and after absorbing I could tell that my redness faded a bit so I love the formula too. It’s also very lightweight for morning use since I love light formulas in the morning so I highly recommend this product! 
222882228, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pad ,Rachael S.,Oily,35-44," These feel so soothing and also cleansing but if you want also offer super mild exfoliation if you use the barely textured grid side. There is also a ton of liquid toner left in the container so they won't dry out, and plastic tweezers that actually fit inside the tub (huge pet peeve of mine when tweezers and scoops don't fit in the product container) to keep the product clean. I also have the essence, which I love, and have used the sheet masks (also loved and plan to repurchase) and I think I may need the moisturizer too. These toner pads feel like they can do so many for someone with sensitive skin on a budget if you ask me as they can exfoliate, tone, feel similar to the essence, and since I ran out of their sheet masks I bet I can stick a few of these in the fridge and lay them on my face until I buy more. Also 70 pads for the price is a great buy! "
278682458, On Hydro LPP Treatment ,Bre,Combination,35-44," Adding this treatment in permanently to my rotation. I bleach my hair regularly, so happy to find something that makes it soft, moisturized, but not heavy. Hard to find good treatments that are silicone free. I like the smell of the shampoo better than the treatment, but both are pleasant. Scent isn’t overwhelming. Wish they had larger sizes since my hair is long but still a good price point. "
278682458, On Hydro LPP Treatment ,Libby,Dry,25-35, SO impressed with the results. My hair is half lightened and has been really dry and frizzy from the weather + hard water. No conditioner has really effectively made my hair feel soft or healthy since bleaching it. This makes my hair look like Virgin hair in terms of quality and health. Really really happy to have gotten this. 
278682458, On Hydro LPP Treatment ,Ginger,Oily,18-24," I can’t believe how great this is for such a decent price. I used this after color treating my hair and it was pretty dry, this worked amazingly for me. My hair tends to be pretty dry sometimes as it is, especially in the colder months, so this has been amazing for that. It looked and felt NOTICEABLY better after using this just one time, I couldn’t believe it! I definitely need to buy more of this!! "
428421551, On The Hyaluronic Acid 3 Serum ,SooJung P.,Dry,25-35," I wanted to give hyaluronic acid one more chance but I have given up. I have dry skin and I have tried hyaluronic acid from different brands before and they didn’t work out as well. The more I used this one by Cosrx, the more I felt my skin was getting drier and drier. I tried to use it in different steps of my skin care step and searched how to use it for people with dry skin. I even tried using this when my skin was a bit wet. When I have it on my skin, it seems ok, still not hydrating, but once I wash my face, my face seems terribly dry. "
428421551, On The Hyaluronic Acid 3 Serum ,Maria,Dry,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
444407050, On The Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Wash ,Cindy C.,Combination,35-44, I'm not sure if it's me or just the sensitive reaction to any oil product. I'm giving it another try in a months time to see. Love the feel of the product though. 
444407050, On The Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Wash ,Britt,Dry,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
444407050, On The Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Wash ,Lauren,Dry,18-24," I’ve purchased this twice already! And I get hype, I have very dry skin and this is very hydrating and nourishing. It doesn’t really have a scent to it, a little goes a long way! So glad sokoglam is carrying these products now! "
444407050, On The Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Wash ,Saman G.,Dry,18-24, This is my favorite Naturium soap! It's very smooth and has a slight scent to it. It goes by fast but a repurchase for sure. 
292938600, On Collagen Peptide Hydra Ampoule ,Debra P.,Dry,45-55, This is amazing. Makes my face feel and look hydrated. Love to use under makeup also. Reminds me of CosRx triple Hyaluronic acid. Very happy 😊 
292938600, On Collagen Peptide Hydra Ampoule ,Cherie M.,Combination,25-35, Have been using this for a few weeks now and the first thing I noticed was how big the bottle is compared to some of the other serums I've tried from Soko Glam! A little goes a long way and I love the texture of it - it's not sticky but very moisturizing. 
292938600, On Collagen Peptide Hydra Ampoule ,Lyndsay,Combination,25-35, I’ve been using this for a couple weeks I’ve definitely noticed my skin more glowing and my lines have been fading around my eyes. I’m 35 years old anything I can do to help my skin looking younger and fresh without surgery. It’s a must have 
267730526, On Time Revolution Artemisia Pack Foam Cleanser ,Nicole H.,Dry,35-44, My face feels so clean after I use this foam cleanser. I’m outside with my kids this summer and this cleaner gets all that dirt out. I have dry skin and this cleaner does both tough jobs of getting my skin clean and not dry. 
267730526, On Time Revolution Artemisia Pack Foam Cleanser ,Lyse H.,Oily,25-35, A+ 
267730526, On Time Revolution Artemisia Pack Foam Cleanser ,Bernadette,Dry,18-24," So I think this is a great cleanser, it makes my face feel clean but not in a stripped sense. However, it might just be me and my skin type, but I question if this is for everyday use. By my third night using it (I personally use it day + night) I think it really threw my skin into a frenzy and this has caused my skin's ph to be thrown off wack so maybe this can be just a night cleanser or a 2x a week cleanser. "
291823362, On Honey Lip Balm ,Elysia L.,Dry,35-44," I have VERY cracked, dry and peeling lips for the last several years. I have tried aquaphor, Carmen, Burts bees you name it basically and I've tried it with only temporary results. I have been using this for about three weeks and my lips have ever felt softer. They aren't peeling anymore, and they are much less sensitive. I apply three times a day in a very thick layer and that keeps them protected from whatever it is that bothers them. "
291823362, On Honey Lip Balm ,Julia P.,Combination,25-35," It was just ok. Did the job, but didn’t stay put on my lips like a waxier lip balm. "
291823362, On Honey Lip Balm ,Diana E.,Dry,25-35,We're so sorry to hear that this lip balm didn't work out for you. Please reach out to us at 
255648259, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner ,Ami,Combination,No," I've been using Acwell Licorice pH Balancing Cleansing Toner for years now and occasionally try new toners in between but nothing has ever impressed me until now. Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner is gentle, hydrating and comes in a HUGE bottle. My (40yo) skin is somewhat sensitive, combination, and I use tretinoin at night. I haven't had any allergic reactions and skin has been feeling glowy and healthy. I still love Acwell toner and have been alternating between the two. "
255648259, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner ,ingrid,No,45-55," This toner has a slightly thicker texture than water, which is the perfect consistency. It's super hydrating. I think my skin has brightened up slightly after a month of use, It's a huge bottle that will probably last me 8 months with daily use. "
255648259, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner ,Sarah G.,25-35,Combination, Love this toner which gives a light first moisture burst after washing. Non sticky formula and super hydrating perfect for winter months. 
255648259, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner ,Melissa S.,Sensitive,No, I was worried this would make me breakout as I’m sensitive to fermented skincare ingredients but WOW this is soo good!! I’ve only been using it for a week but I already notice my skin is more balanced and generally brighter. In the past I’ve stuck with the Son and Park Beauty Water or the Only Good Skin Days toner but this one has become my go-to! 
255648259, On Bifida Biome Ampoule Toner ,LSon,No,35-44, Adding this toner to my winter regiment. Noticeably smaller pores and hydrates! 
248635345, On Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream ,Tenzin T.,Combination,45-55, It’s not moisturizing enough. My skin got drier after using it consistently for few days 
248635345, On Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream ,Caroline P.,Combination,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
248635345, On Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream ,Elizabeth L.,Combination,25-35, I love this! Has very soft hydrabeads that burst and leave my skin hydrated ALL DAY LONG. Who knew birch trees could give me such a fabulous glow! 
248635345, On Birch Juice Moisturizing Cream ,Melody,Sensitive,55+, Not impressed. I don’t use it daily coz it’s not that exciting to use. 
282431220, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Oil ,Seraphina,Combination,35-44," I am a fan of the SOLVED Coconut Cleansing Pads but have switched over to this cleanser because I started to feel guilty about using so much material for this first step. This oil cleanser is gentle and does a great job dissolving any makeup and/or sunscreen before I use my SOLVED Coconut Foaming Cleanser. The green tea leaves at the bottom is a nice touch. Also, the bottle is a nice size so it takes a while to finish. "
282431220, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Oil ,John Y.,Dry,25-35," It’s been great for double cleansing. I use it before my other cleanser and it helps get all the sunscreen off. It has a very thin consistency, just like an oil. "
282431220, On Real Fresh Green Tea Cleansing Oil ,emily,Oily,25-35, i don’t like that it has a white film to it and it doesn’t take off all of my makeup. the smell isn’t the greatest and it feel like it doesn’t really do much. i will say it does make your skin feel moisturized right after you use it but that’s the only thing i like. i really wanted to love this product because i love anything that has green tea in it when it comes to skin care but just couldn’t with this product. 
248634603, On Time Stop Peptide Eye Cream For Face ,Calvin C.,Oily,25-35, My dark circles have mostly disappeared and my eyes are looking so much tighter in the areas I use it on. I'm not sure how to describe it but it really leave the eyes looking youthful and tight on the skin. 
248634603, On Time Stop Peptide Eye Cream For Face ,Rayleigh,Oily,25-35," This eye cream is very rich and keeps my eye area VERY hydrated. It doesn't really help that my skin is oily and I don't really have any dryness concerns around the eyes, so it can get a bit 'greasy' in appearance. I still do like and recommend this eye cream, but to those that have very dry under eye areas. I will keep using this product, along with applying it to my face and neck...why not? It's great to also apply in these areas. "
248634603, On Time Stop Peptide Eye Cream For Face ,Sara,Normal,25-35," This eye cream is just okay — it’s not that hydrating and had a gel like, watery texture. Would prefer something thicker "
254939585, On Brillie Hand Wash Variety Set ,Samira S.,Combination,No, Cute set 
254939585, On Brillie Hand Wash Variety Set ,Nelyn D.,No,35-44," These are great. I love that it’s non drying to the hands especially since my hands are already dry enough from frequent hand washing and sanitizer use from work, and with the winter coming. I also love the refillable system concept. "
254939585, On Brillie Hand Wash Variety Set ,Cristina,25-35,Dry," Good refillable hand soap, if that's what you are looking for! Probably wouldn't have bought it on my own, but it is a nice product that does what it says. The scents are lovely and the foam is luxurious. "
254939585, On Brillie Hand Wash Variety Set ,SooJung P.,Normal,Yes," For the price point, I would say it’s very good. I love that the bottle is reusable but would be great if they fixed the packaging of the pouches if they were going the environmentally friendly route. These scents were not my favorite sadly. Do recommend tho. "
254939585, On Brillie Hand Wash Variety Set ,Choura,Yes,25-35," I like this soap, but it’s not something I would have bought on my own. The best part is the low waste aspect, but I wish the container wasn’t plastic. "
308904347, On Full Fit Propolis Light Ampoule ,Zack,Combination,25-35, I actually can’t tell how I feel about this product. Definitely no negative side effects but I can’t zero in on if it’s doing anything for my skin. 
308904347, On Full Fit Propolis Light Ampoule ,M D.,Combination,<18, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
308904347, On Full Fit Propolis Light Ampoule ,Diana G.,Normal,18-24, Instant glass skin with a temporary sticky texture as a side effect lol 
308904347, On Full Fit Propolis Light Ampoule ,Tammy,Dry,25-35, One of the best ampoules ever. This has saved my skin while adding retinol to my routine. 
225274020, On Pore Cleansing Balm AHA ,Erin,Dry,35-44, I love this oil cleanser! It feels great on my skin and does a great job cleansing. There’s a slight citrus smell that makes it feel like washing my face is a luxurious experience instead of something I have to do. The consistency is like a balm that melts in your hands as it warms and doesn’t leave an overly oily residue. Would highly recommend! 
225274020, On Pore Cleansing Balm AHA ,Alexandra C.,Combination,18-24," This was my first time trying a cleansing balm and I'm glad to say this didn't disappoint! It melted nicely into the skin and removed makeup well. One thing I did notice was that my skin would become more oily than usual if I used it twice a day, so I stuck to only using it at night. "
225274020, On Pore Cleansing Balm AHA ,Janice L.,Combination,>55, This cleansing balm deep cleans and leave your skin refreshed and not dired out. 
225274020, On Pore Cleansing Balm AHA ,Angi,Sensitive,35-44," I use this product once a week because I have KP. It has helped in keeping these areas smoother than usual. The parts of my skin not affected by KP are like butta and I love it. I intend on increasing usage to as much as my skin can tolerate to help my rough, bumpy skin. "
225274020, On Pore Cleansing Balm AHA ,Kim,Combination,45-55," So nice for my combo skin. I like it almost as much as the Then I Met You cleansing balm. Nice alternative, as I like to switch things up from time to time. It does have a citrusy scent, which would normally bother me, but somehow I don't mind it w/this product., maybe b/c it works so well. "
318072718, On Cotton Cloud Probiotic Power Mask ,Solveig,Combination,25-35, This mask is very gentle and leaves your face feeling soft and refreshed. It did not dry out my skin at all or cause any texture. 
318072718, On Cotton Cloud Probiotic Power Mask ,Jennifer C.,Combination,45-55, Perhaps these are for skin that's much younger??? The formula was very light and the mask didn't cover the entire face. 
318072718, On Cotton Cloud Probiotic Power Mask ,Caressa S.,Combination,45-55, Love these masks! Skin feels so good after using and well hydrated! 
318072718, On Cotton Cloud Probiotic Power Mask ,Waneda O.,Sensitive,35-44, This is the cutest packaging and the sheet mask is amazing! I purchased 3 more after I used the first one because it was so good. Leaves your face feeling so soft and supple. 
318072718, On Cotton Cloud Probiotic Power Mask ,S.S,Combination,18-24, This mask is my holy grail 
308904238, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Booster Serum ,rihmonkey,35-44, No," Good Serum, It made my skin feel and look amazing. Definitely buying more!!! "
308904238, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Booster Serum ,Teri R., No,Loss of Firmness, Love the AHA/BHA Vitamin C booster. Everything I have tried from COSRX has made major changes in my skin for the better. Your products are a breath of fresh air. My skin has not looked better in many years. Thank you COSRX! I have finally found my Holy Grail in skin care! 
308904238, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Booster Serum ,dawn,Deep Lines/Creases,65+," I have used this product day and night and have been very happy. I do get slightly dry or irritated around the eye""s "
308904238, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Booster Serum ,Jasmine,Combination,55+,"in the winter, careful around the eye's. Skin is smooth ,lines softer, and over all appearance. "
308904238, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Booster Serum ,Tammy,Combination,25-35, I hate putting a poor review but I purchased this because of the decent reviews and I was in the market of looking for a new vitamin c serum. When I went to open this I noticed on the bottle label it said “Cautions: people with allergy to aspirin will react poorly to the betaine one salicylate.” No where on this product page does it say that. I decided to put a little drop on the back of my hand to see if it’ll be okay and needless to say I definitely felt a burning sensation followed with an itch. I am so bummed I cannot use this because I am allergic to aspirin and unfortunately I cannot return it because I already opened it. 
211728114, On 5-Step Acne + Oil Control Set ,Shere D.,Combination,35-44," Since I’ve been using this set, I’ve been breaking out even more than usual. Is it purging or ?  "
211728114, On 5-Step Acne + Oil Control Set ,Rick K.,Combination,18-24,Trying to stick it out another week to see. I like how the toner feels but the oil & the 2 other solution & cream I’m not sure why I’m greasier than usual. My eczema has fired up + the extra bad breakouts. Not sure why … 
211728114, On 5-Step Acne + Oil Control Set ,Alexa o.,Combination,25-35, My acne is very stubborn and consistent. So far I have seen the best results and I’m really sticking to these products. At first my skin purged for a while the first couple of days but now it’s been a consistent week of using these products and my skin honestly looks so refreshed and glowy. I still have acne bumps which is the most stubborn part about my acne so I’m hoping I will see a difference in that but other than that I recommend! 
211728114, On 5-Step Acne + Oil Control Set ,Kristine,Oily,18-24, I do love it but something is making me feel greasy 
344610048, On Kind Atmosphere Biome Mist ,Anna,Sensitive,18-24," I was so excited to use this and only got it as a ""treat yourself"" purchase, but I was so disappointed. Firstly, the price tag is too high so I expected it to be amazing. Secondly, did not meet my expectations at all and made me regret buying it. I just finished using half of the bottle after months because I just don't reach for it. Doesn't leave my skin feeling hydrated or glowy or plump or anything. Rather get the Dokdo toner and put it in a spray bottle. Disappointed in Superegg... "
344610048, On Kind Atmosphere Biome Mist ,DAR,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
344610048, On Kind Atmosphere Biome Mist ,kiera,Combination,18-24, A nice mist as a mid day refresh but I’m not sure it’s any better or worse than some less expensive options. 
246695666, On True Water Deep Moisture Cream EX ,Nicole H.,Combination,25-35," This product is definitely not worth the price tag. I really liked their gel mask as an overnight mask which works wonderfully so I gave this a try. So disappointed. Even though it's winter, other products I've used as my last step have held up well for most of the day. With this, I'm lucky if I get two hours before my skin feels like paper. "
246695666, On True Water Deep Moisture Cream EX ,Stacey,Combination,25-35,Thanks for your feedback!  
267730384, On Jade Facial Roller ,Chloe,Combination,18-24," I love incorporating this into my routine, and it's always super nice and cooling in the morning. After about three months I have had no issues with it, considering how many other rollers have reviews saying that they broke very quickly. "
267730384, On Jade Facial Roller ,Gabbi,Combination,25-35," I have seen other rollers at TJ Maxx and while they might be cheaper, they are not as sturdy. Worth the extra $ in my opinion. It will last you longer. "
267730384, On Jade Facial Roller ,Nelyn D.,Dry,25-35, It looks very pretty. I love the color. And it seems more stable looking than the ones I usually see in the store. I’ve been using the smaller roller for my face though. I feel like using the smaller one is more effective as I feel it more as compared to when I use the bigger one. But it could just be me. 
255648315, On Galactomy Essence Cream ,Mariah K.,Normal,No," I was needing a heavier moisturizer for winter and this is doing the job fairly well. I can't really say I've noticed it doing much beyond that, but I haven't had any problems with it either. It's a fairly thick cream and hasn't broken me out at all. "
255648315, On Galactomy Essence Cream ,Tori W.,No,25-35," I really like this moisturizer, it really gives you a nice subtle glow. Will buy again. "
255648315, On Galactomy Essence Cream ,Ann,25-35,Oily, I am using this moisturizer as part of my night time skin care routine. I notice that it really made my skin soft when I wake up but not oily. 
255648315, On Galactomy Essence Cream ,Adnaan H.,Combination,No, Okay so the only con I found with this product was how little the bottle is that’s it. 
255648315, On Galactomy Essence Cream ,Vanessa O.,No,25-35,The product itself is amazinggggg I apply some at night time as my last step and when i wake up my skin is brighter and my acne scars are a bit lightened which is what i wanted !!!! 
252599195, On Cafferonic Body Scrub ,Solveig,Combination,25-35, This may be my favorite purchase I have made from Soko Glam. I struggle with mild-moderate body acne and have struggled to find something to help. I have only used this product a few times paired with the tea tree care body spray by Klavuu and WOW WOW WOW I already see a difference in my skin. I am so impressed by just a few uses. I am definitely buying the whole set and will keep purchasing in the future. What a GREAT product. It also has a nice smell to it. 
252599195, On Cafferonic Body Scrub ,Lyn,Dry,25-35, It honestly doesn’t seem like the product does anything for me. I’m better off using coffee grounds and an oil mix for a scrub. 
252599195, On Cafferonic Body Scrub ,Sandra,Dry,25-35,We are sorry to hear that about your Cafferonic Body Scrub. Please reach out to us via email at 
252599195, On Cafferonic Body Scrub ,Nelyn D.,Combination,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
408183825, On Multi-Bright Tranexamic Acid Treatment 5% ,Avery C.,Combination,25-35," I love this acid treatment, I've been using for a month and already notice brightening effects. "
408183825, On Multi-Bright Tranexamic Acid Treatment 5% ,Robert,Combination,18-24, I can't believe there's finally a product combining all the best ingredients for fading PIH. The texture is gorgeous and the effects are amazingly fast! Will repurchase it for sure. 
408183825, On Multi-Bright Tranexamic Acid Treatment 5% ,Melissa,Combination,25-35," It provides a nice layer of hydration and seems to even my skin tone out. I'm not sure how well it fades hyperpigmentation yet, because I have not used it consistently enough. "
408183825, On Multi-Bright Tranexamic Acid Treatment 5% ,Rachel F.,Dry,25-35, Lovely product that helps to brighten my skin. The texture is wonderful and easy to work into the skin. Definitely would recommend this and will be buying again 
231853405, On Moisture Boost Cooling Marine Concentrate Serum ,Kelsey,Normal,25-35," I have tried a few different serums since being introduced to skin care routines 2 years ago, but this is the product I keep going back to. "
231853405, On Moisture Boost Cooling Marine Concentrate Serum ,Stacy B.,Combination,35-44, This is one of the best serums I’ve tried. It’s so calming on my skin and it the added boost I need in the winter. 
231853405, On Moisture Boost Cooling Marine Concentrate Serum ,Waneda O.,Sensitive,35-44, I probably purchased this based off the cute packaging alone. It was soothing but I had an allergic reaction to this product so had to stop using. 
238343491, On Oil to Milk Cleanser ,Mackenzie,Combination,18-24," I love this makeup remover/oil cleanser. It is good for removing face makeup, but it doesn’t do a good job at removing mascara. It stings my eyes and makes me feel like my eyelashes fall out. But not a problem for me because I use micellar water on my eyes. It doesn’t irritate my skin and has a good texture for massaging your face! "
238343491, On Oil to Milk Cleanser ,Megan J.,Normal,25-35," This smells insanely gross. I honest-to-God gagged when I smelled this cleanser, I can't even use it. It smells like plastic, in the worst way possible. It's also pretty thin. "
238343491, On Oil to Milk Cleanser ,Mrschulenberg@yaoo.com,Sensitive,25-35, I’d never heard of this type of wash. I was hesitant because my skin has been acne prone in the past. I have been blown away. My skin loves it! It’s definitely an adjustment from typical washes but well worth it! 
238343491, On Oil to Milk Cleanser ,Robin P.,Combination,25-35," This wash is very light, and at first I thought I had to add more to cleanse more, I was wrong. With just the smallest amount my face turns into a soft milk bath. Then I rinse and the light cleanser had put so much moisture in my skin instead of away! "
247391381, On Grain Water Cleansing Oil ,cony2004,Combination,25-35," It sucks to write this because I was very excited about this cleanser, but it simply did not work out for me. My skin felt itchy and iritated after just few times of using it. I wanted to love this product, but unfortunatelly it was a waste of money for me. "
247391381, On Grain Water Cleansing Oil ,Alexandra,Dry,25-35,We're so sorry to hear that this cleanser didn't work out for you. Please reach out to us at 
247391381, On Grain Water Cleansing Oil ,Lily,Dry,25-35, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted:) 
154470368, On Fresh Herb Origin Toner ,Isabella N.,Normal,25-35, My skin gets a little tingly and not quite irritated but a little bumpy after I put this on. I didn’t feel it prepared my skin for the next step very well either. My skin doesn’t seem to like toners with these main ingredients so this one was a no for me. 
154470368, On Fresh Herb Origin Toner ,Y R.,Combination,25-35,I'm so sorry to hear this item did not work out for you! Please kindly email our team at 
154470368, On Fresh Herb Origin Toner ,Sheree C.,Combination,18-24," about this item, along with your order number. We'll be happy to get you all sorted out. Thanks! :) "
417254833, On Order of the Eclipse Hyaluronic Cream ,charlene w.,Combination,35-44, A little goes a long way! My face feels so luxurious after I apply this cream! 
417254833, On Order of the Eclipse Hyaluronic Cream ,Jaime T.,Dry,35-44," This is by far one of the best new products to hit the beauty market. This cream is genius. It provides non-greasy, lasting hydration like no other. Truly a game-changer. I will not be without this cream. Ever. "
417254833, On Order of the Eclipse Hyaluronic Cream ,Nina A.,Normal,35-44," Really like this cream, I’m so glad I tried it. It’s super hydrating (skin looks plump in the morning), has almost no scent, and the packaging is so cute. Will be adding to the rotation for the winter months! "
292938125, On Calming Duo Cica Mask ,Bonnie,Normal,18-24," This totally works but is nearly impossible to get onto your face neatly. It is so soaked, you really can't get it to lay flat. "
292938125, On Calming Duo Cica Mask ,Amber H.,Oily,35-44, Soothes at red blemishes and overall complexion looks revived my go to 
292938125, On Calming Duo Cica Mask ,Riley P.,Combination,18-24, Didn’t do much for me. 
289130274, On Niacinamide Gel Cream 5% ,Autumn J.,Oily,25-35, This makes my skin look and feel like nothing else I have ever tried! It feels just as moisturizing as a moisturizer and lightweight like a serum. My skin is brighter and my acne scares are leas visible. I even got my mom to give it a shot! 
289130274, On Niacinamide Gel Cream 5% ,Jas,Oily,25-35," I love this moisturizer! I have extremely oily skin, and gel creams are the only moisturizers I use because regular face lotions are too heavy for my skin type. Every other gel cream I tried are better than regular face creams, but still made my face look kind of greasy. This gel cream moisturizes my face, and this is the only gel cream I’ve tried that doesn’t make me look greasy and oily afterwards. And it’s fragrance free, so that’s a plus! I don’t know if I would recommend this to people with dry or even normal skin, but I would definitely recommend to people with oily skin like mine. This is my new go to for gel creams! "
289130274, On Niacinamide Gel Cream 5% ,Rebecca B.,Oily,25-35," This is my first time trying this cream and I’m pleasantly surprised. I have very oily skin and definitely gets more “ greasy” as the day goes on . I wanted to find a good day cream that would hydrate my skin well but not make it appear shiny . This cream works great , absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave a greasy shine . If you need a little more added moisture try pairing this cream with your favorite serum for a more dewy finish . Also wanted to add the ingredients are really good quality for the price . "
289130274, On Niacinamide Gel Cream 5% ,Zainab,Dry,25-35," I ordered this gel cream based on the recommendation from a customer care representative. Unfortunately I don't think this is best suited for dry skin, I've used this consistently for two weeks and no matter how much product I use my skin seems to feel extremely dehydrated. All the products I layer under it seem to sucked up by the cream. I wouldn't recommend for dry skin, perhaps oily skin? Still on the search for something to parch my dehydrated skin. "
243345304, On Curly Studio All Day Rise Mascara ,Eris,Sensitive,18-24, This stuff holds the lash so well but it literally will not come off. I’ve used many popular brands and micellar water has always removed it. Two rounds of makeup remover as well as literal coconut oil will not remove this stuff and my lashes are left very hard. 
243345304, On Curly Studio All Day Rise Mascara ,katerynabeauty,Combination,25-35,We're so sorry to hear that this product didn't work out for you. Please reach out to us at

431859620, On Mighty Patch - Micropoint ,Rachael,Normal,25-35," Man, these little guys work hard! I was hesitant to pay more than $2 per patch, but I knew that the patches with micropoints were better than patches without, so I thought I'd give them a try. Boy, am I glad I did! Whenever I feel a cycstic pimple starting to bloom, I slap one of these guys on there, and it kills it within a day. I've had two pimples go from red, irritated, and painful, to deflated and painless literally overnight. Plus, when you apply the patches, you can feel the micropoints penetrating those first couple layers of skin -- I know that probably won't excite everyone, but I love it!  "
308904143, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Gel Cleanser ,Lorie L.,35-44, No, It doesn’t fit to my skin unfortunately 
308904143, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Gel Cleanser ,Olivia, No,Loss of Firmness, I’ve been using this cleanser for about a year now and it is by far my favorite I’ve used. When I started I immediately noticed an improvement in the softness of my skin and I no longer worry about roughness or bumpiness (though these were admittedly not my biggest concerns). I don’t mind the fragrance since it’s a cleanser and not a moisturizer. It is often the second step of my double cleanse after the DHC Deep Cleansing Oil but it can definitely stand on its own. 
308904143, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Gel Cleanser ,swati s.,Dull/Uneven Skin,18-24, Its been 2 weeks since i am using these products. Didn’t notice any change. Finger crossed. 
308904143, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Gel Cleanser ,john,25-34, No, This cleanser really works well to cleanse my skin without leaving it feeling stripped of moisture. 
308904143, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Gel Cleanser ,Val, No,Other, Have been using it for a while now and have to say it’s awesome cleanser! Love the feel and the texture and how it feels after wash! Love it 
308904472, On Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel ,Na'ilah S.,Normal,25-35, I use this right after cleansing. And as I was using it it didn’t feel like anything at all. But my skinnnn felt baby softtttttt after one use. It’s very very gentle so I use it every night or every other night after cleaning. But even that often may not be necessary 
308904472, On Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel ,Andrew Y.,25-34, No, Very easy on the skin and feels super soft afterwards. Only been using it for few weeks so far. Love it! 
308904472, On Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel ,Robyn V., No,Dull/Uneven Skin," I personally like how my face feels after using it, but I just don’t feel like it’s necessary for me "
308904472, On Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel ,Genielen T.,Dull/Uneven Skin,25-34, I just tried and purchase and feels good. I put this on my underarm too. 
308904472, On Low pH Good Night Soft Peeling Gel ,Adia H.,35-44, No, When you rub in the masque it feels like your skin is being very gently exfoliated and my skin does feel softer! Just be aware that there’s a bit of pilling if you don’t like that texture. 
308904275, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Daily Cream ,Pamela V.,Combination,25-35," This moisturizer is the best, is helping with everything. I only thing, I think this moisturizer is only for the winter. "
308904275, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Daily Cream ,Joee,Combination,18-24, Personally I found this to be too light for my skin and I needed to apply a second my hydrating moisturizer but if you are looking for a very lightweight water like consistency in a moisturizer this is it. It’s very nice overall and I did notice a brightness to my skin but I just needed more 
308904275, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Daily Cream ,Na'ilah S.,Normal,25-35, Very light weight gel type consistency. I’m using this as moisturizer one and going over it with a thicker creamier moisturizer. 
308904275, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Daily Cream ,Katia W.,35-44, No, I use this in my nightly routine. I’ve noticed a significant reduction in skin texture with the loss of bumps. 
308904275, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Daily Cream ,Astrid L., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, Mi piel se ve y se siente mejor. 
278682114, On Keratin LPP Shampoo ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," This really didn't do great things for my hair. It left it a bit stripped, and not soft. "
278682114, On Keratin LPP Shampoo ,Jennifer L.,Sensitive,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skin and hair care is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your hair type & preferences. "
278682114, On Keratin LPP Shampoo ,P. S.,Sensitive,35-44, Leaves hair soft and clean without stripping hair natural oils. Not a big fan of the scent even though is very light. 
179208195, On Rice Pure Gel and Cream ,Quan C.,Sensitive,25-35," I wanted to love this product. I bought it, excited and ready to try it out. However, it broke out my skin. I have sensitive skin and I am careful with the products I put on my face. I did research in this product, and thought it would work out, but this was not it. I also did not like how it made my face feel sticky. The product did not feel as if it was absorbing into my skin. "
179208195, On Rice Pure Gel and Cream ,Amanda S.,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and I’m sorry that this cream did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
179208195, On Rice Pure Gel and Cream ,Andrea,Dry,35-44," I spent hours researching and looking for a good simple moisturizer for my oily skin. And it always came down to too simple in ingredients to very nourishing and ally of active ingredients. I was so overwhelmed, and almost always had 3 or 4 moisturizers in my shopping basket. When I came across this one, I was so shocked to see it gave the user the choice of how light or how heavy you needed it. Immediately I wanted it, and ever since using it I have been able to feed my skin what it needs any given day. Love love love! "
218040371, On Let's Carrot Oil Toner ,Ally,Sensitive,25-35, I got this mist as a reward and I will definitely be buying once I run out! I use this every night after work and I find it works super well to give my skin a pick-me-up and boosts my moisturizer’s performance! 
218040371, On Let's Carrot Oil Toner ,Rachel C.,Combination,25-35, I love the mist. It is oil based but does not feel oily on my skin at all. A lot of my hyperpigmentation has faded since using it. 
218040371, On Let's Carrot Oil Toner ,sarah,Dry,18-24, used this for my scalp nd roots and it helped alot with flakiness!! hair grew really well 
218040371, On Let's Carrot Oil Toner ,Michelle,Combination,35-44," I have Combo skin; however, getting closer to my 40's my skin has become unpredictable at times. This recently has become my SAVIOR when my skin out of nowhere decides the retinol product I've been using for years is too harsh for my skin, when I woke up to my face literally peeling! My skin was so quickly soaking this up & it doesn't leave a greasy feel at all; I started by spraying it on the palm of my hand & gently patting on my face, but I've now realized it's not too much to spray right on. I'm going to ALWAYS keep a bottle on hand for those unpredictable skin days! "
218040371, On Let's Carrot Oil Toner ,Sarah,Dry,18-24," the texture of the toner was a little too thin for me and didnt see much of a difference when using it, however i used it on my scalp and it helped hydrate it well! "
188968753, On Vinegar Kombucha Essence ,Jessica A.,Combination,25-35, I have been using this product basically everyday for 3 weeks now and since week one I noticed a big change on my skin. Its feels smooth hydrated and its really been helpful to control and prevent acne breakouts! I only skip it when using AHA once or twice a week and it has not dryed or irritated my skin. 
188968753, On Vinegar Kombucha Essence ,Robin E.,Combination,45-55," Refreshing, works well for my combination sensitive skin "
188968753, On Vinegar Kombucha Essence ,caitlin,Combination,18-24, got this as a sample and used the whole bottle! i need to get another full sized one 
188968753, On Vinegar Kombucha Essence ,Kristy G.,Combination,55+," I love this toner. I believe I received it the 2020 Advent calender and have been waiting to buy the big bottle since then. So glad the day finally arrived. This toner leaves my face feeling clean, it seems like it evens out my combination skin. My face just signs with relief after using. I follow it up with an essence. Love it. "
188968753, On Vinegar Kombucha Essence ,Noreen,Combination,25-35, I got the mini size in the advent calendar. I was traveling so I brought this and I started using this in place of my regular chemical exfoliant for a week. This is the best my skin has looked in years. 
242457194, On SoonJung Cica Relief Toner Pad ,Ce,Sensitive,Sensitive, This dried out my skin and gave me dehydration lines. If you have dehydrated skin proceed with caution 
242457194, On SoonJung Cica Relief Toner Pad ,mel,Sensitive,35-44, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
242457194, On SoonJung Cica Relief Toner Pad ,Anna W.,Sensitive,18-24," I have super sensitive skin - rosacea, acne, dryness, etc. Not only do these pads not irritate my skin but I feel like they really do soothe it. I use them every morning with my rosacea cream and at night with my harsh anti-aging products. I always keep one container on back-up to make sure I never run out! "
242457194, On SoonJung Cica Relief Toner Pad ,Kelly,Dry,25-35, i love these pads. it really soothes the skin 
236159058, On Honey Glow Cream ,Cassie,Normal,25-35," I bought this cuz my normal moisturizer wasn't enough for this winter. The packaging is so cute! The moisturizer smells great, super creamy, and keeps my skin hydrated during this cold season. "
236159058, On Honey Glow Cream ,Amber,Sensitive,35-44," My SO and I live in the desert, and this is the cream I reach for when the winds start to blow and humidity drops below 40%. Yesterday it was so dry and windy, my SO even let me put some on his face and in his beard and let me tell you, he aged backwards 5 years and his beard became so soft. He woke up this morning and told me how much he enjoyed how soft his skin and beard feels, something he NEVER does.  "
236159058, On Honey Glow Cream ,hae,Normal,25-35,This really seems best for the driest weather when your barrier really needs that extra something. I wouldn’t recommend it for very oily skin. My skin is pretty sensitive and still struggles with hormonal breakouts but when I use this I haven’t noticed anything but relief. 
236159058, On Honey Glow Cream ,alyssa,Dry,18-24," I have a normal skin and its not so bad even though I dont maintain it well, This is so greesy that I have to use only at night on the day time I look like I have applied castor oil on my face LOL. After using few nights It opened my pores and caused breakouts. I am a returning customer for SG and I always had a good feeling about the products that I ordered. But this choice of mine turned down my impression on SG "
278681947, On Green Tea Fresh Serum ,Courtni A.,Oily,25-35, I use this serum in combination with other products I got from Soko Glam but it’s been really effective for me and I’m grateful for the results. I’ve been hoping to come into 2023 with a new skin care routine since the older line of products I use no longer are available so this is perfect. 
278681947, On Green Tea Fresh Serum ,Kurt J.,Combination,25-35, Sinks right into the skin and the texture is perfect! Gotta love the ingredients also too ✨ 
278681947, On Green Tea Fresh Serum ,Michelle,Combination,35-44," I recently went a little overboard with retinal; while I always do wear SPF, I think possibly not drinking enough water could've contributed too, but this was the ONLY serum I had that actually helped my Sensitive Peeling Skin! This along with a Oil Toner we're my saviors! I've never going to not have this at home! "
278681947, On Green Tea Fresh Serum ,Lauren,Sensitive,25-35," I can’t say much about this serum. I haven’t noticed a difference, good or bad. It may be that I just like my other skincare products better. I had hoped this would be similar to the Isntree Green Tea toner but I find them different on my oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. "
408181046, On BHA Liquid Exfoliant 2% ,Jarshu,Combination,25-35," I use this once or twice a week but it irritates my skin every time. I have been using it for almost 3 months now, hard to tell the improvement on the skin. "
408181046, On BHA Liquid Exfoliant 2% ,Christine,Combination,35-44,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
408181046, On BHA Liquid Exfoliant 2% ,TuVan N.,Oily,25-35, You apply it just like toner and leave it on. It’s so nice for a busy mom like me. I don’t have time for me a lot but this works so well all the dry winter skin is gone 
289369888, On Real Aqua Balancing Stick Cream ,Trishina R.,Dry,25-35," I'm a nurse and bring this with me to work! If I need to give my skin a bit of hydration during my 12 hour shift, THIS IS IT. So easy and compact and not sticky. soft and smooth! "
289369888, On Real Aqua Balancing Stick Cream ,Momo,Dry,18-24," I have dry, sensitive skin with redness issues. This is such a good product! I mostly use this for when my skin needs a hydration boost. It also has a very pleasant cooling effect upon application, which is a plus! I didn't realize how small it is for the price that they're charging; was hoping for a lot more product for this price point. But this is definitely a must for on-the-go moisturizer! "
289369888, On Real Aqua Balancing Stick Cream ,Sabrina,Combination,18-24, I absolutely love this moisturizing stick!!! It's so handy to have during the day while I'm out and about working! I especially love to use it during the winter months! It works so well and always leaved my skin feeling very moist and hydrated! 
289369888, On Real Aqua Balancing Stick Cream ,janene w.,Sensitive,>55, I keep this at work and in between patients I can just place this on my face where I need it to keep feeling clean and hydrated 
289369888, On Real Aqua Balancing Stick Cream ,Erica,Oily,25-35," Perhaps I was expecting too much out of this moisturizing stick. I bought it because I was going through a phase of dry, flaking skin due to introduction of acne products and wanted a convenient way to reapply moisturizer. I pulled back on all actives and laid on a thick, basic moisturizer as an initial layer, using the stick to reapply throughout the day. "
301807018, On Apricot Collagen Youth Firming Cream ,Sarah P.,Combination,35-44, I love this apricot collagen firming cream. 
417252308, On Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening ,Angela C.,Combination,35-44," Bought this as part of my two step cleansing routine. It smells great, is perfect for removing makeup at the end of the day. Doesn’t upset my sensitive skin or clog my pores. Rinses away just great with no residue and a little definitely goes along way. I have tried other clean it zero cleansing balms and this is by far my favorite. Will definitely be purchasing it again. "
417252308, On Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening ,Kristy,Normal,45-55, I like all of Banila’s balms. This one definitely has a different consistency but I don’t mind it. Also love the orange smell. It works as well as the other balms from this manufacturer. 
417252308, On Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening ,Waneda O.,Sensitive,25-35, I’ve tried almost all of their different cleansing balms and this is just as great! Does not irritate my skin like other brands with brightening ingredients. Will keep using! 
417252308, On Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening ,L,Sensitive,18-24," I bought this on a whim and sort of as a final test because every other oil cleanser I’ve ever tried never worked out. (Beauty of Joseon’s ginseng one, Enature’s hemp one, Klog’s plant one, Versed, Hanskin… the list goes on). I also didn’t realize this had limonene until after I ordered and was ready to be disappointed because my skin is ridiculously sensitive, yet it somehow didn’t irritate my skin in the slightest? Really surprising considering the strong citrus scent! I love all things citrus but, again, have sensitive skin so fragrance isn’t exactly something I want in my skincare.  "
246695920, On White Truffle Body Glow Spray Serum ,Kati C.,Combination,25-35, This spray dries quickly and I love the feeling of my skin after using. However it is very short lived. I haven't noticed any anti-inflammatory properties or visual improvements to my skin yet. 
246695920, On White Truffle Body Glow Spray Serum ,oliveoil,Combination,18-24," I like that it is easy to apply, smells good and makes my skin shine but all of this is very short termed. Because it is a spray, it gets ALL over the floors and I even slipped on it once because it is so oily. The scent smells very good but the effect doesn't last long. "
246695920, On White Truffle Body Glow Spray Serum ,Ivy D.,Combination,25-35," I was originally nervous to try this product, I have pretty normal skin on my body, but I wanted something to give a bit of glow and also if I wanted, something for my perfumes to stick to scent-wise. "
278682658, On MadeCera Pink Aloe Builder Pads ,Laura T.,Dry,35-44," I am still playing around with where exactly I use this in my routine (after cleansing, or toner? If I use a mask, before or after?) but I really like the addition of a pad-based product in my routine. I think since I started skincare as a young teenager with Noxzema pads, I really dig the feeling of sweeping this over my skin. It’s fragrance is a very light, clean scent. It hydrates well too, and I love the flip top lid rather than a screw top. "
278682658, On MadeCera Pink Aloe Builder Pads ,Kelly,Combination,35-44," These pages are so good at calming and balancing my skin. I will reorder these and that's alot bc I am a skincare junkie and want to buy every new product or there. If I'm buying something I already bought, I know it's good! "
278682658, On MadeCera Pink Aloe Builder Pads ,Kelly,Combination,35-44," These are great. They are hydrating yet with ingredients that treat acne, discoloration and texture. So gentle yet effective. "
278682658, On MadeCera Pink Aloe Builder Pads ,Rachael S.,Oily,35-44," These are awesome! They work as a light cleanser if you don't need to rid yourself of any layers of makeup or sunscreen, and/or a toner pad if you use the lightly textured side. They are so full of moisture though that even with the salicylic acid they can be used as an essence pad or left on for a few minutes as a mask. They are good for travel too as there isn't really extra liquid to spill out in a bag or anything and the jar is a flip-top lid (it screws off too but this way you don't lose it or drop it on a dirty floor). "
289116090, On Half Step Flash Facial ,Ilona K.,Sensitive,45-55, I love it. It's my must have in my skin care routine. I apply twice a week to avoid skin irritation. It has acidic smell which doesn't bother me at all. have some varicose veins and vein spiders. 
289116090, On Half Step Flash Facial ,Evie B.,Sensitive,25-35," This truly is an at home facial, it’s smoothing without being irritating for my sensitive skin. For days after I have noticeably softer skin! It brightens as well! Love it "
289116090, On Half Step Flash Facial ,Samantha,Combination,35-44," I picked this as a reward on a whim, so did not have any expectations. I am also somewhat of a product skeptic, This is the only product I have ever tried that has had significant, immediate, visible results from the very first use. After using, my skin was so soft, smooth, and hydrated, and I had some blemishes that were significantly reduced/less visible. My skin looked and felt like I'd just come from the spa. As a bonus, it's super quick and easy to use. There is a bit of tingling while it's on, but no redness or irritation at all. I am sold and will definitely buy again! "
289116090, On Half Step Flash Facial ,Rachel F.,Dry,25-35, Only used a couple of times so far. It’s a beautiful chemical exfoliating product that I use once a week in between facial treatments. It’s affordable as it’s going to last a while due to the frequency of usage. Leaves my skin feeling smooth. 
289116090, On Half Step Flash Facial ,Makaela,Oily,25-35, My face feels so soft after using this. It is quite strong and tingles on my sensitive skin. I only use it 1-2 times per week but it makes my skin feel great every time I use it 
417253388, On Clean it Zero Brightening Peeling Gel ,charlene w.,Combination,35-44, I have used peels before but this is by far the best! It washes off nicely without residue and I have a nice glow afterwards. 
417253388, On Clean it Zero Brightening Peeling Gel ,Mandy G.,Combination,35-44, This is great for exfoliating! I use it 1-2 times a week and it delivers on the results! My face feels very smooth and bright every time! 
417253388, On Clean it Zero Brightening Peeling Gel ,Michaela H.,Combination,25-35," It has just a little more 'grit' than other peeling gels, so I feel it exfoliates much better. It has a nice citrus scent thats not overpowering and leaves my skin so smooth + bright! "
417253388, On Clean it Zero Brightening Peeling Gel ,Solveig,Combination,25-35, This is a great exfoliant. Lately I have been using it while in the shower for easy clean up. 
292939014, On Skin Essentials Cica Care Balm ,Melissa,Combination,25-35," I love that this is hydrating and moisturizing without being too greasy. Even though I use at night, it's fine for me to use during the day as well. Helps soothe my skin after exfoliating or using retinol. "
292939014, On Skin Essentials Cica Care Balm ,Melissa M.,Combination,25-35," I love using this after exfoliating or when I have breakouts-- it calms everything down. It has a slight rose scent that I don't mind (and I typically dislike rose). It provides good hydration and moisture, but it isn't too thick; although I normally use it at night, I have used it during the day and it wasn't too heavy. "
292939014, On Skin Essentials Cica Care Balm ,iris,Combination,<18, soo easy on the skin. noticed remarkable changes in 2 days 
292939014, On Skin Essentials Cica Care Balm ,sarah,Combination,35-44," Je la recommande sans hésiter ! Superbe crème pour les peaux sensibles, elle hydrate et nourrit la peau en profondeur sans graisser la peau. Elle calme les irritations cutanées. "
197808953, On Carrot Deep Clear Remover Oil Pad ,Mathias,Dry,18-24, The pads feels so good on the skin. It really does give me a squeeky good clean! 
197808953, On Carrot Deep Clear Remover Oil Pad ,Rocio,Oily,18-24, I’ve purchased this item not too long and it removes ALL OF MY MAKEUP! Not harsh on my oily skin. 
197808953, On Carrot Deep Clear Remover Oil Pad ,K,Oily,25-35," As the title says, it is great removing oil but something in the formula made my eyes itch and burn for about an hour after application. I tried it again once with the same issue before I just gave it away but I don’t know if they dealt with the same issue. "
257309792, On Argan Oil Silk Plus Hair Mask ,Ilona K.,Dry,45-55," My hair look better even though I applied only twice. I can't mix in one routine cleaning oil , pack and treatment. It was too much and my hair looked oily. Today I skipped oiling hair and is much better. Even styling hair seems to be easier. "
257309792, On Argan Oil Silk Plus Hair Mask ,S.S,Combination,18-24, I used it only twice so far and I'm seeing improvement in my hair 
257309792, On Argan Oil Silk Plus Hair Mask ,Alexandria M.,Dry,25-35, Better than expected! I'm a black woman with relaxed hair. This product made my hair thicker. 
257309792, On Argan Oil Silk Plus Hair Mask ,Carrie H.,Combination,25-35," Very high quality product, especially for the price. Perfect for everyday use as a conditioner or as a mask. "
257309792, On Argan Oil Silk Plus Hair Mask ,Arya,Dry,25-35," I have thick, curly Indian hair and this mask works on my hair! Def made it smoother and softer. Still a few flyaways afterwards but I solved that with a leave-in product. Overall, would re-purchase. "
212912661, On Purple Plant Cream Mask ,Gina L.,Sensitive,Yes," After using this mask, my skin felt smooth! It's a very gentle mask and feels cool upon application. Def love it. "
212912661, On Purple Plant Cream Mask ,Nadejda Z.,Yes,25-35, I love it! 
212912661, On Purple Plant Cream Mask ,A O.,45-55,Normal, Cute packaging. Surprisingly big container. I was just watching a drama where a mermaid does relaxing mud face care in a beautiful lagoon and this transported me there! It's a very lightly fragranced mask that is a little difficult to spread on your face with the included applicator because it slips right off the plastic but super easy to just use your fingers. It glides right on and sits lightly on your skin. I was worried it was going to be heavy and suffocating but it was light and nice. It washed off pretty easily with gentle circles in warm water. My skin feels hydrated and happy after using it for ~7 minutes. 
212912661, On Purple Plant Cream Mask ,Zoe,Sensitive,Yes," This mask is soothing and it does exfoliate nicely. I didn't see too much of a difference in my skin, however. I typically use the Neogen exfoliators, which cause my skin to glow amazingly. This was a nice mask still, it just didn't have that 'wow' factor. "
212912661, On Purple Plant Cream Mask ,Charlene H.,Yes,18-24," This feels super rich on my skin. Best of all, it spreads on so easily and washes off pretty quickly while leaving my skin feeling smooth and moisturized - perfect for my sensitive and acne-prone skin. It has some texture in it for exfoliation, but it's gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my skin. Also, I love that I only need to leave it on for 5-10 min and it does the job. "
262234143, On Safe me. Relief Moisture Cleansing Foam ,sherry h.,Combination,55+, Just a small dab on my cleansing pad and away all the daily dirt & grime goes. It smells wonderful too. Love this product 
262234143, On Safe me. Relief Moisture Cleansing Foam ,Olivia,Sensitive,25-35," Not sure exactly what ingredient caused the cystic acne on my cheeks (I never get cystic acne) or caused the little red bumps everywhere, I just know I am throwing this face wash out. Really doesn't help that it smells like a throat lozenge either... "
262234143, On Safe me. Relief Moisture Cleansing Foam ,Ce,Sensitive,18-24, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
262234143, On Safe me. Relief Moisture Cleansing Foam ,Stephanie,Sensitive,Sensitive," I have struggled to find a great cleanser for my skin type, my skin changes throughout the year but is always sensitive and prone to breakouts. After using this product, I have noticed major changes in my skin. My skin is less sensitive which is great during the cold weather and my breakouts have calmed down. I have also received compliments on my skin!! "
307863177, On Hanskin Seven Layer Ceramide Lip Balm ,Autumn R.,Dry,25-35," As far as lip balms go, this one is pretty average — not great but not terrible, either. Not a fan of the fragrance, though. It smells artificially floral. "
307863177, On Hanskin Seven Layer Ceramide Lip Balm ,Azaelia G.,Sensitive,18-24, 1. Not enough product for the price 
307863177, On Hanskin Seven Layer Ceramide Lip Balm ,Rachael S.,Combination,35-44,2. For me personally it exacerbated a lip dermatitis reaction I had instead of helping. 
307863177, On Hanskin Seven Layer Ceramide Lip Balm ,Karen R.,Normal,35-44,I kept using it to see if it was a fluke but the product ran out before I could be sure that it was worth anything. Two stars because I like the texture of it. 
444407551, On Multi Vitamin Daily Nutrient Body Wash ,Elizabeth C.,Combination,25-35," This is my first time dabbing into skin care for my ""whole body"" and not just my face and I am loving this new experience. Body wash is non stripping and leaves my body soft. Make sure to follow with the matching lotion. "
444407551, On Multi Vitamin Daily Nutrient Body Wash ,Nicole,Combination,25-35," I love this for daily use, it makes my skin feel actually clean. "
444407551, On Multi Vitamin Daily Nutrient Body Wash ,Sandi S.,Dry,55+, Love all products I have purchased. 
444407551, On Multi Vitamin Daily Nutrient Body Wash ,Mozett C.,Oily,18-24, This body wash is perfect as an everyday body wash. My skin feels clean without feeling dry after I love it! 
444407551, On Multi Vitamin Daily Nutrient Body Wash ,Lauren W.,Normal,25-35," My husband has been loving this body wash and for someone that loves his cheap bar soap, that says a lot. Very gentle and doesn’t leave skin feeling stripped. "
158600187, On Gentle Face Cleaning Remover Pad ,Rachael S.,Oily,35-44," For pads as opposed to wipes these are a good size for cleansing and they are really soft. I don't need to rinse even with oily skin after either if I follow up with my Goodal Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pads and use the embossed side of the pad to remove any dead cells or cleanser left behind. Overall a good option for a waterless cleanser for sensitive or sensitized skin, though would still prefer a wipe with an embossed side for exfoliating and water-based as opposed to oil-based. Also rinsing is optional - it doesn't evaporate fast after using it but the ingredients are moisturizing if you do nothing else. "
158600187, On Gentle Face Cleaning Remover Pad ,Debra P.,Dry,45-55, Makes skin soft and no irritations. 
158600187, On Gentle Face Cleaning Remover Pad ,Kerri,Combination,25-35, I haven't tried using these to remove make up so I can't speak on that. I noticed the key ingredients for these are similar to the toning pads. So for about a week now I've been using these pads as a post cleansing toner since I've run out of my regular toner and they've worked great. I don't know if I'm actually supposed to rinse after using but I haven't LOL I use a retinol based serum for my hormonal acne and it hasn't had a bad reactions with it. I also have to say that these have been really great in hydrating my face; my skin is parched in the winter. 
158600187, On Gentle Face Cleaning Remover Pad ,Maria G.,Combination,55+," Es un producto que me gusta mucho, facil de usar y efectivo, lo recomiendo "
158600187, On Gentle Face Cleaning Remover Pad ,Alisha,Dry,45-55," I received this as a birthday gift. Thank you, Soko Glam! I know the description and directions state that these are “cleansing” pads, but I would go one (or two) steps further with my cleansing routine. I don’t feel that these should in any way, shape, or form, replace the cleansing step as they do not cleanse that well; this coming from someone whom doesn’t wear foundation and on occasion, mascara and eyeliner. I’ve had them for over a month and I’ve tried using them twice instead of double-cleansing and my skin was not happy. My skin needs actual water to start the hydration process, which these do not supply. I believe that these pads would be okay to “refresh” the skin midday or after a workout until you can get home to actually wash your face, but the jar is huge and isn’t travel-friendly. "
267730242, On Madecassoside Ampoule 2X ,Nicolette K.,Normal,25-35, It's silky smooth and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. 
267730242, On Madecassoside Ampoule 2X ,Courtney G.,Combination,35-44, Feels great. My skin is not responding great to it though. My skin doesn’t really respond well to much though. Think it’s just not the product for me. 
267730242, On Madecassoside Ampoule 2X ,Ana C.,Dry,55+, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
267730242, On Madecassoside Ampoule 2X ,Jessica,Combination,25-35," Absolutely love love these products out of all the expensive products I have tried, this product line has caught my attention for the way it goes on your skin clean, not greasy yeah very hydrating and for this I will remain a loyal user keep up the great products. And don’t discontinue any pls. "
431859890, On Mighty Patch - Nose ,Eva P.,Combination,18-24," If you have raised pores or pimples on the rise these work like the pimple patches. It works really well and I love using them but the application is a struggle. It is hard to peel from the plastic and if it touches itself you'll never be able to pull it apart for it to be flat again... The shape to is a bit awkward for my nose shape. Overall though I do like, I just wish it was easier to put on without risking ruining it. "
431859890, On Mighty Patch - Nose ,ariel c.,Combination,18-24," there was barely any goop on the mask after 6hrs, don’t know if it’s that’s good bc i don’t have clogged pores or bad if it didn’t work correctly, lol. either way i rather have these on hand then not. "
417260254, On Real Vitamin C Serum ,Vanessa L.,Combination,18-24," Nice packaging for the product, in a glass bottle. So far my skin seems to be getting even after a few weeks use. "
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Maddy,Dry,35-44," I like the green tint, and the clean ingredients. It was slightly too mattifying for my dry skin. I prefer something that feels a little more moisturizing. It's frustrating to use my skincare to try to get a good glow, and then to put on sunscreen and all the glow is gone. But for someone with oilier skin, this is probably an excellent choice. "
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Elizabeth C.,Combination,25-35, I am pleasantly surprised with how much I like this sunscreen. It is great for winter months were there isn't that much sun during this season. My face is less oily throughout the day and I love the green in it. The sunscreen has not caused any breakouts and I would definitely buy again. I just wished it had a stronger SPF for better protection but for that reason I am only using it for the winter months for now and will reconsider using it this summer. 
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Angie D.,Sensitive,25-35," This sunscreen has a super light and non greasy finish which I love! It's great for warmer and more humid temperatures and I think it would be good for acne-prone skin since it's so light. The green tint does fade and works in nicely to your skin to help reduce redness, but it'll take a little bit of time for it to absorb. The only reason I docked a star was because I love the idea of a pump for dispensing but sometimes the pump is a bit finicky. "
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Waneda O.,Normal,25-35, This one goes on very nice and does not leave any residues behind. I really like the light feel of the SPF knowing it still provides a high level of sun protection. 
431859799, On Mighty Patch - Invisible+ ,Jessica A.,Combination,25-35, Favorite brands compared to others 
431859799, On Mighty Patch - Invisible+ ,Gabbi,Combination,25-35, These are the only patches I use! 
278682078, On ACV Vinegar Hair Cap (5 Sheets) ,Cristabell,Normal,25-35," I used 4 caps in past two weeks. My hair is so soft, definitely keeps my ph level healthy, and gets rid of scalp built up. I use it after shampooing and conditioning. Only problem have to add hair tie of my own, doesn’t stay in place. "
278682078, On ACV Vinegar Hair Cap (5 Sheets) ,Mercedes,Dry,25-35, This has honestly helped my hair so much my hair now feels so soft and healthy 
408182027, On Azelaic Topical Acid 10% ,Alexa,Dry,45-55, I got this to try the line and fell in love with it. I noticed a difference in my within 2 weeks of using it. I also found it to be really hydrating for my skin. I am now looking into buying more products from them. 
408182027, On Azelaic Topical Acid 10% ,Rachael S.,Combination,35-44," Was VERY difficult to open, and you need more than you think to get it on evenly as it dries up very quickly even on oily skin (seems to be evaporating faster than sinking in). The emulsion would have been a better choice as it would be more spreadable and you can still apply moisturizers on top of that as well too. "
339565392, On Barely There Tinted Lip Oil ,Solvieg,Combination,25-35," I like this for the gloss affect, but I did not find it had any color which is disappointing. For reference, I have lighter color lips that are a neutral pink. If you are looking for a nice gloss I think this works just fine, but just be mindful that it may not give you the color you are looking for. You can definitely pair it with a lipstick to add some extra glam to your look. "
320422986, On Some by Mi AHA-BHA-PHA 30 Days Miracle Truecica Clear Pad ,Allina,Normal,25-35," I was a little nervous about how harsh these might be; however, they aren't harsh at all. In fact, my skin feels soft and and moist afterwards. These have also been great for my small breakouts. The next morning my blemishes are noticeably reduced. "
320422986, On Some by Mi AHA-BHA-PHA 30 Days Miracle Truecica Clear Pad ,Rachael S.,Combination,35-44," I am in love with a specific combination of ingredients for my combo/oily skin that has to go through a lot (like migraine injections every few weeks for one example): Cica + Houttuynia Cordata + Artemisia/Mugwort. Alone these ingredients are good but combined are a powerhouse for preventing or treating breakouts, maskne issues like irritation, and reducing redness and inflammation - all while making my skin feel nourished and not like it is covered in grease. Adding so much tea tree is such a bonus for me too as I'm immunocompromised and keep it in the house to add to practically everything anyway. Also the astringent properties of the Willow Bark is great for my pores on my nose and forehead, yet It isn't drying for my skin, and doesn't make me peel. If it came with the fliptop lid the MadeCera PinkAloe pads come in, or if that lid fits this jar? **chef's kiss** "
301807387, On Pore Active Treatment ,Rachael,Normal,25-35," This was my first acid, and I have to admit, I was pretty nervous to use it at first. Really had no idea what to expect.  "
257310060, On Honey Rich Body Wash ,Anessa O.,Dry,18-24," I was looking forward to this product for my back acne. I have dry skin on my back so I thought this would help to hydrate while getting rid of acne. However I have seen no difference in my acne at all, and my skin feels the same. I would be lying to say I was not disappointed. "
257310060, On Honey Rich Body Wash ,Samantha,Normal,25-35, and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
257310060, On Honey Rich Body Wash ,Lyudmyla M.,Combination,25-35, The scent is light but I expected it to smell more like honey. We finished the bottle. It's a regular body wash. The packaging is cute tho 
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Autumn R.,Dry,25-35," This moisturizer is thick without being heavy. Many moisturizers are too thin for me, leaving my face feeling tight by midday. Not this stuff. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump. Plus I love that it comes in a tube! Way more hygienic than a jar. "
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Melissa,Combination,25-35, The only product I have tried recently that is helping repair my damaged skin barrier 
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Melissa M.,Combination,25-35," I destroyed my skin barrier in December with retinol and tried multiple products without much luck. Enter this product! My skin barrier is finally starting to recover. It has not broken me out, and it is thick without being greasy. I prefer to use it at night, but it is okay for day use as well. "
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Linda L.,Dry,35-44, This cream relieved dryness and irritation. It is really thick and perfect for my evening routine. I'm not too keen on the scent but very keen on the results! 
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Harshali,Dry,25-35," This cream is exactly what it says it is and delivers on that moistness. It is PACKED with ceramides, and both type of ceramides that our skin barrier needs - hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic ones. So it gets absorbed into the deeper layers of the skin as well. The cream has a slightly thick and rich texture but it goes on the skin easily and does not feel greasy.  "
307862592, On Seven Layer Ceramide Serum ,Carol R.,Combination,35-44," This is hydrating and lightweight enough for humid climates! One pump is enough. At night, I use two pumps and not use moisturizer and it seems to work for me. I would repurchase :) "
307862592, On Seven Layer Ceramide Serum ,Lisa G.,Dry,25-35," If you want the ceramide serum equivalent of Pokemon’s Gotta Catch ‘Em All, look no further than the Hanskin Seven Layer Ceramide Serum. This emulsion texture has seven ceramides (ergo the name), plus a ceramide precursor, panthenol, cholesterol, beta glucan, urea and panthenol, basically making it a one-stop shop for skin barrier support. The texture can feel a bit tacky at first, but it dries down easily. And the price! Ceramides are expensive to formulate with, but the price per mL is great on this. I’ve got a lot of ceramide serums I love and while this one might not be the most elegant, I’ll probably rebuy it. "
307862592, On Seven Layer Ceramide Serum ,Debb,Combination,35-44," FINALLY! I’ve been looking for something that can sub in for Dr. Jart’s Ceramidin Liquid—and I finally found it!! Thanks for curating this because it’s hard enough to find ceramide serums. And this is equally as velvety smooth and fast absorbing as the Dr. Jart’s serum. We’re in the hot, humid June season but I can still use it. I love it in the morning right after my hydrating toner when I don’t want to use a moisturizer right away. Please keep this stocked on SOKO Glam! "
301806792, On Apricot Collagen Youth Firming Ampoule ,Linda L.,Dry,35-44, I think my age spots are beginning to fade after adding this to my routine. It is gentle and smells nice. My face feels more elastic and certainly more moist and dewy. 
301806792, On Apricot Collagen Youth Firming Ampoule ,Kira M.,Combination,25-35," I had heard such great things about this ampoule and it did not disappoint. I saw immediate results, my skin seemed to smooth and soften. But there is a perfect amount of firmness as well. I will definitely be purchasing again. "
226705770, On Lacto Cica Locking Serum ,CeCe,Combination,>55," After reading the reviews I decided to try since the reviews were positive and they were correct. I'm in my late 60's still dealing with cystic acne , and dryness with redness from using Retinal products. The pads are so soothing and refreshing. The pads have eased the redness. I highly recommend the pads. "
226705770, On Lacto Cica Locking Serum ,Fiona W.,Sensitive,18-24, This did helped me skin soothe and calm down more! Love it to use it as my toner step at night. 
226705770, On Lacto Cica Locking Serum ,Lauren P.,Sensitive,35-44, I am currently 7 months pregnant and have had horrific acne and lesions on my face like a mask for the entirety of my pregnancy. I’ve tried everything and all of it has just exacerbated the situation. I came to soko glam got a skin analysis and bought the recommended products. This product has saved me literally. I’ve only had the product for 2 weeks and I already look completely different. No acne in sight. Scars fading and some gone already. Lesions almost gone and no more dryness cracking and bleeding and severe redness anymore. If I could hug soko glam I would in a heart beat. This product has allowed me to heal my rash almost completely. I will never go without it! 
226705770, On Lacto Cica Locking Serum ,Lacey,Sensitive,35-44, I feel like these pads have completely changed my skin's hydration and redness in the best way. I have redness in my cheeks and on my forehead and my skin looks and feels so much healthier. 
292938489, On Soonhan Houttuynia Calming Cream ,Harshali,Sensitive,25-35," I love this cream so much more than I expected to. It has a soft, pillowy feel to it and feels so cooling and calming on the skin. It also smells amazing! My skin drank this up and it helped soothe my peeling skin from using tretinoin. "
292938489, On Soonhan Houttuynia Calming Cream ,Grace C.,Combination,35-44," I’ve been like Goldilocks searching for a face cream, and I’ve found it. This Hanskin cream is super moisturizing without being sticky/greasy, absorbs well but doesn’t dry out completely, has just enough of a natural scent that it doesn’t smell too perfumey or too bland. After use, my skin feels comfortable and soothed until my next wash. It’s perfect! I’m almost done with my first tub and have two brand new ones on stand by. "
292938489, On Soonhan Houttuynia Calming Cream ,Donna H.,Combination,45-55," Super gentle, super hydrating, I love that it feels weightless but really gets the job done. "
292938489, On Soonhan Houttuynia Calming Cream ,Girley,Oily,35-44," I asked SG for recommendation to reduce rosacea and they recommended this. It works greatly on my skin, it's very light and moisturize my skin perfectly. "
292938489, On Soonhan Houttuynia Calming Cream ,Christine I.,Combination,18-24," I have combination skin that has been especially dehydrated recently and this is a miracle. It is the perfect balance of hydrating and moisturizing, and its calming properties is a bonus with the hot summer weather and my sometimes sensitive skin.  "
408178740, On Silk SPF ,Jessica H.,Combination,25-35, This is definitely a great sunscreen for everyday wear. I hardly feel anything on my face except smooth skin. 
431860030, On Rescue Balm Original ,Sara B.,Normal,25-35," Love this stuff, but the bottle is TINY. Would wait for another sale to repurchase (but I do like it enough to repurchase.) "
431860030, On Rescue Balm Original ,Molly,Dry,35-44," I've only used the Rescue Balm for two days (twice a day) on a couple of persistent red spots that have been lingering post-breakout. I can already notice a difference. The balm feels nourishing, a little heavy for daytime wear so I put more on at night. "
292938418, On Soonhan Houttuynia First Essence ,Minyuan H.,Combination,35-44," If you’re looking for a calming essence, this is the one for you. I use this when my skin is acting up and I need to bring it back to normal. I also use this with the calming ampoule (same product line). Very gentle but still hydrating. "
292938418, On Soonhan Houttuynia First Essence ,Aniella R.,Combination,25-35," So I've wrecked my skin trying to do too much too fast and ended up with a very unhappy skin barrier. Aside from taking easier now I incorporated this essence to my skin care and it helped soooo much! My skin stopped being so angry at me. Now that it's colder I started doing the 7 skin technique, thing, with this essence and boy, my skin glows and feels oh so good! Really happy I was recommended this by the sokoglam team. "
292938418, On Soonhan Houttuynia First Essence ,Caleb S.,Combination,18-24, Such a wonderful product that leaves my skin so moisturized. It doesn’t dry right. Absolutely a must for every K-skin care routine. 
292938418, On Soonhan Houttuynia First Essence ,Kurt J.,Dry,35-44, My boyfriend ended up stealing this from me lol because he said it’s perfect for after shaving since it has helped with irritation and redness for him immensely. Will definitely keep purchasing! 
356394898, On Chasin’ Rabbits Drunken Hand Pomade ,Jennifer S.,Combination,35-44," I like using this morning and night when I am also applying my cuticle oil. It does have a temporary greasy feel but I always apply onto back of my hands and rum in most of it before getting on my palms. Any extra greasy feeling I rub my palms into my elbows and it’s all good. I did struggle with the packaging when opening, foil came off but left a layer of plastic I didn’t notice and thought it was just extremely hard to push from tube. Until I checked it again and got the rest of the plastic removed! "
356394898, On Chasin’ Rabbits Drunken Hand Pomade ,Anna,Dry,18-24, I love how it smells (sweet mangoes with a hint of herbs so it's not TOO sweet) and how thick it is. It's definitely not for people who want a thin consistency but it melts beautifully in your hands and doesn't leave a sticky feeling at all. Everyone always compliments the scent and asks for a bit! 
356394898, On Chasin’ Rabbits Drunken Hand Pomade ,neil,Dry,25-35," Wow, I purchased this during the black Friday sale as a treat to myself, and wow! I selected the drunken mango scent, and it smells like a spa. So relaxing, but also slightly sweet with the mango. Also, it's thick! Which I prefer in a hand cream. 10/10 "
356394898, On Chasin’ Rabbits Drunken Hand Pomade ,Aitor S.,Sensitive,25-35, Amazing scent and the texture is not grease at all after absorbed. Recommended if you like vanilla and peppermint scent. 
289370065, On On-the-Glow Blush and Illuminator - Bare ,Tina W.,Normal,>55," Nice flush of color, blends easily for a natural looking flush, the glow is also nice and more of a shine to highlight high points also blends well, I’m lazy and like the ease of dotting on skin then blending with fingers, stayed on through mask wearing!, not sure how much product there is, but each side twists up when cap is unscrewed., I like the product and think it’d be great on trips "
444407876, On Pregame Primer ,Alisa,Normal,45-55," I bought this because I wanted a primer that would help my make up go on smoother and keep it on longer. Unfortunately, it did the opposite. My mascara started to come off 2 hours after I put it on. That never happened before I used this product. Other than that, it has a cool and funny packaging so that was nice. And putting it on was no issue. I just wish it did what it claimed to do. "
444407876, On Pregame Primer ,Michelle R.,Dry,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
253722813, On Chasin' Rabbits Limited Edition Set ,Nicole,Combination,25-35," I've been using this set for a couple of days now and so far I am LOVING it! Usually, I have a pretty oily T-Zone, but since it's been getting colder, my skin has been so dry it was literally flaking off. I've been using this set morning and night and it doesn't leave my skin feeling tight like my last cleanser. I like that this leaves my skin feeling and looking hydrated all day. I think I am going to find something a little more intensive for night moisturizer. I'm giving it 4-stars because I will have to keep using it to see how it really affects my skin after longer use, but if it continues the way it is, it's an easy 5-star set! Also the little bag and stickers are such a cute touch and I love the headband, it fits very well without being too tight. "
253722813, On Chasin' Rabbits Limited Edition Set ,Rachel L.,Dry,45-55," I love these products so I decided to buy myself this gift set. I am a little disappointed. I should have just saved the extra money and bought the 3 full sized products separately. The bag and headband is not worth the extra $10. The headband is small and keeps popping off my head (I just have an average sized head!) The bag is what the products were packed in and it has writing about the products all over it. That makes it a little awkward, imo. "
253722813, On Chasin' Rabbits Limited Edition Set ,Kylie J.,Dry,25-35,"If you want to make your own set, I suggest you just buy all 3 separate products and the adorable and functional $5 headband from Etude House. "
301806518, On Hypoallergenic Cica Pick Up Mask ,Ce,Sensitive,No," Let me preface this by saving I have sensitive skin. I was hoping that this having cica in it would work out good for me, but that was not the case. My most favorite holy grail cleanser (that appears to have been discontinued) has cica in it and makes my sensitive skin so happy. I was hoping to achieve the same results with this mask, but it was not meant to be. I used one of these masks today and it left my skin with tiny bumps and acne breakouts. The mask also didn't smell very good. "
301806518, On Hypoallergenic Cica Pick Up Mask ,Elizabeth L.,Oily,Yes, with your order number and we will be happy to get you all sorted! 
301806518, On Hypoallergenic Cica Pick Up Mask ,l1lmiss,Yes,45-55, I received these “pick up masks” to try and I have to say they feel wonderful on my face. I have added them to my routine and use them every other day. They are soothing to my skin and the wipes are full of the moisture ingredients just as described. 
301806518, On Hypoallergenic Cica Pick Up Mask ,Lisa,>55,Sensitive," My sensitive ,aged skin loves it "
344610294, On Healthy Skin Essentials Set ,Minyuan H.,Combination,35-44, This set is definitely worth the price because almost all of the products are full size. I’m keeping some of the products and giving some to a friend. I’m especially a fan of the Hanskin essence that comes with this set. 
344610294, On Healthy Skin Essentials Set ,alyssa,Sensitive,25-35," This set caused me to repurchase multiple products in this assortment. Neogen Day-Light Protection Airy Sunscreen, Isntree Green Tea Fresh Serum, and I'm From Mugwort Mask. These products stood out to me, and I also liked this essence but didn't get the chance to repurchase. This set is best during the summer time, especially if you live in the southern hemisphere. "
344610294, On Healthy Skin Essentials Set ,Solveig,Combination,25-35," Try the mugwart mask after it's been in the fridge for a while and use it after exfoliating, it feels absolutely wonderful and has a cooling affect. It is very calming and refreshing! "
344610294, On Healthy Skin Essentials Set ,Amy,Combination,25-35,"This essence is absolutely delightful. My face feels so light and SOFT. I didn't anticipate it being so light since it is a little thicker of an essence, but it is truly a delight,  "
340463387, On CC Water ,NR,Oily,45-55," I love this CC water for year round use! I have oily skin, so this light version works for me. It makes my skin look beautiful without looking like it has heavy make-up on. It looks more natural than foundation. The slightly darker tint (compared to the CC cream) works for me (I use caramel). This is the only base I use now, with primer and sunscreen underneath during the day. I will continue to buy this forever! "
340463387, On CC Water ,Amy,Combination,55+, I don't wear makeup and I wanted something just to make my skin even this is perfect it's very light feels like I don't have anything on my skin and takes away all of the uneven skin tones 
340463387, On CC Water ,Rachel L.,Sensitive,45-55, I wanted something to replace my IT Cosmetics CC Cream. This was not it … The coverage is so light. It may (or may not - I really couldn’t tell) even out skin tone but that is about it. 
431859710, On Mighty Patch - Surface ,Jordan P.,Combination,25-35," For a while I've wanted a patch that covers a larger area on my chin for when I get lots of small breakouts so it's nice to finally have this although depending on the angle I stick it on my face, it doesn't always stay on through the night. "
431860377, On Force Shield Supercharged Reset Mist ,Autumn R.,Dry,25-35," I like this face mist. It’s cooling, refreshing, and smells good, too. I’m not sure if it’s really doing anything to improve my skin, but I’m enjoying it all the same. "
431860377, On Force Shield Supercharged Reset Mist ,Molly,Dry,35-44," I'm a few days into using this mist and generally I like the way it feels but the smell is slightly...clinical? It's not the refreshing, botanical scent I was hoping for/expecting. I'll continue to use it for the (hopeful) skin benefits, but it's not the go-to I was wanting. "
246695938, On Professional Repairing Hair Perfume Serum ,C B.,Dry,35-44," I was so excited about this product but it fell flat for me in almost every way. I was shocked by how little you receive for the expensive price tag. Secondly, the ""perfume"" aspect of this is really the opposite for me... the fragrance isn't the best, but fortunately (or unfortunately, if this is what you were hoping for) it didn't last long. But I think it was supposed to? Also, shine sprays must walk a fine line to add shine and control without appearing as though you haven't washed your hair in a week. For me, this product achieved the latter. A lot of money for a product I know that I will never use again. "
282431369, On Double Date Lip and Cheek Duo - Honeymoon/Swipe ,Naomi,Combination,18-24, I was a bit skeptical at first as I am usually not a fan of liquid like blush but OMG this one is so so so good. I love how smooth it lifts and the pigmentation is awesome!!! The blending of it is also great!! I love it so much :) 
282431369, On Double Date Lip and Cheek Duo - Honeymoon/Swipe ,Sara B.,Normal,25-35," Beautiful color, great compact design, but less creamy than I'd like for applying with fingers and the color layer is too dry for my lips. The glossy layer works great for lips and as a highlight. Would repurchase for sure. But slight bummer to need an applicator to apply (as I hoped I could pop it in my pocket for going out without a purse) "
282431369, On Double Date Lip and Cheek Duo - Honeymoon/Swipe ,Karen R.,Combination,55+, Perfect for on the go. Put a little on and if I need more later it fits in my pocket I enjoy that the best! 
282431369, On Double Date Lip and Cheek Duo - Honeymoon/Swipe ,Amber,Sensitive,35-44," This balm has a very nice texture that glides on the cheeks well. A little tends to a go a long way and does last all day. I am not sure about the color and feel like it's a bit too orange for my tone so I don't like it on my lips. Would consider trying in a pinker/redder tone, but overall a nice product. "
356394746, On Chasin’ Rabbits All About Glow Multi-Balm ,Jasmine F.,Combination,18-24," Leaves a very glowy look and shine on your face. Goes on nice and smoothly. However, I feel as though it would be better for those with dry skin as it is very moisturizing and lasts very long. "
358279147, On Chasin' Rabbits Aloe U Vera Much Soothing Gel ,Lily H.,Dry,35-44," I love this soothing gel. It keeps my skin moisturized. The gel is sticky when first applied. Overall, happy with the purchase! "
358279147, On Chasin' Rabbits Aloe U Vera Much Soothing Gel ,hillary,Oily,25-35," I bought this to use as a conductive gel for my microcurrent device and it works exceptionally well! I like this so much more than the gels that come with the device. It’s a beautiful simple formula with great ingredients. Four stars because it dries down sliiiightly sticky and remains a bit sticky for a while. But overall, lovely and lightweight product for added hydration! "
457624041, On Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream Mist ,Aaron B.,45-54, No, Has a very nice mist that makes skin feel cool. Leaves a subtle dew look to face that's nice. Geels good too 
457624041, On Balancium Comfort Ceramide Cream Mist ,Dana S., No,Other," I love everything about this mist! First of all, it sprays out so fine that no product is wasted. It is super hydrating and soothing, especially if you have a compromised barrier. This has become a quick favorite in the couple of weeks that I've been using it! "
457624702, On Hi Amino All Cleansing Oil ,gosia,Combination,35-44, I've been using this oil cleanser for a week now and my skin looks refreshed and glows. I love this item and will purchase it again! 
431860069, On Rescue Balm + Red Correct ,haley f.,Combination,18-24," So, in response to the review that said it turned their skin brown, that happened to me when I attempted to use an old one that had been almost gone for a few weeks and just wanted to see if there was anything left in there. So it was probably a singular product defect. I use this stuff religiously on my hormonal and cystic acne in the am instead of makeup (sometimes i follow w colour pop powder) and it never breaks me out, looks natural, and goes on smooth! I’ll never wear makeup agin after discovering this product. "
431860069, On Rescue Balm + Red Correct ,Jenn,Sensitive,25-35," I was so excited to try this. I haven't worn foundation or concealer since the start of the pandemic... which has done wonders for my skin. BUT! I also have really sensitive skin, so I have quite a bit of redness. I saw this and was hoping it was a much more affordable version of Dr Jarts green tiger balm. Guys this stuff is tinted, and supposedly adjusts to your skin tone. LOL. I'm the color of mayonnaise and like it that way so this stuff literally turned into a brown patch on me. Sooooo disappointing. :( Gonna give it away to a tan friend. "
408183980, On B.O.M. Voyage Cleansing Balm ,cecelia p.,Normal,45-55," too thick, doesn't feel as good as some other balms that turn oily then rinse off easily. this one is almost too thick, doesn't melt down in my hand as well. "
431860324, On Force Shield Superfuel Serum Stick ,Heather,Oily,25-35, Love the stick application - my face is absolutely glowing and I got several compliments. I originally bought for travel but will keep using it. 
431860324, On Force Shield Superfuel Serum Stick ,oliveoil,Combination,18-24," I liked the product at first, it isn't the most moisturizing or long lasting product as it is a serum stick but overtime, it gave me rashes all over my face and my neck. I usually don't have sensitive skin but this product just irritated my skin so badly that my skin was incredibly dry, red and it stung pretty badly for a couple of days afterwards. "
247391426, On Vinegar Kombucha Cream ,Jessica A.,Combination,25-35, This cream has been perfect for cold and dry winter weather! It has a slight thicker consistency but it does not feel heavy or clogs my skin. I love it 
247391426, On Vinegar Kombucha Cream ,Teagan D.,Combination,18-24," Great moisturizing cream that goes on smoothly. It's a bit heavy to use during the day, but I use it as a night cream and wake up with my skin soft and smooth. I love the scent and it feels truly luxurious! "
247391426, On Vinegar Kombucha Cream ,Harvin,Combination,18-24, My go to moisturizer! It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated & bright! It also helps fill in the little smile lines I have. Definitely recommend 🙌🏼 
247391426, On Vinegar Kombucha Cream ,monika j.,Combination,25-35," i wanted a rich moisturizer for the colder weather and while i do like the product, it might be too rich for my combination skin. it feels sticky for a few hours after applying. i expected it to smell sour because of the name but it has a faint sweet scent that is very nice. "
247391426, On Vinegar Kombucha Cream ,Arlene P.,Oily,25-35, Decided to try this moisturizer and found it to be perfect for my skin. I’m oily most days and found that only natural products can help the oil in check. This one is silky smooth and feels decadent without overwhelming my skin. Def worth a try! 
339565731, On Flower Balm - Pink ,Hannah,Oily,25-35," I love this little lip balm, I keep it in my purse and use it throughout the day to give my lips some color. After about the second use the tint stays on your lips, and I always get compliments on the packaging. If you are looking for something super hydrating you can layer a more occlusive balm on top, I like to use aquaphor to give it some shine. Love it! "
339565731, On Flower Balm - Pink ,Allie M.,Combination,25-35," When I first put this on I loved the texture. It felt very moist and I loved the subtle pink color, that seemed to build the more I put on. However, whenever I wear it, I notice quite soon after that my lips feel very dry. Because of this, I avoid wearing it frequently "
408180735, On Black Rice Hyaluronic Anti Wrinkle Serum ,Avi,Combination,25-35, It didn’t make a difference for my fine lines after two months. I do like the packaging and the light scent and it didn’t clog my pores or cause my reactive skin to break out. 
408180735, On Black Rice Hyaluronic Anti Wrinkle Serum ,kiblerea,Dry,25-35," I use this around my eyes and forehead and 100% notice a difference in the elasticity of the skin. After using for ~6 weeks, those areas feel bouncier and very hydrated, huge plus that my under my eye makeup looks way better too! I was just using this in the AM but have switched to using it AM & PM since I loved the results. I use right after my toner / essence / serum step! "
320421512, On Coconut Oil Cleansing Balm ,Crystal,Combination,25-35," This is perfect even on its own, leaves your skin feeling soft and not drying at all. It is not oily either as it washers off really well. It is my favorite of all the oil cleansers. "
344610073, On Tonal Scenery Reparative Serum ,Trishina R.,Dry,25-35, Loving this serum. After applying my skin is glowing. I've been applying at night after cleansing and toning. Makes my skin feel soft and is not sticky. will continue using. 
344610073, On Tonal Scenery Reparative Serum ,Lilly,Sensitive,18-24, Feels great going on and soaks in immediately! I haven’t noticed any brightening (which is what I bought it for) but that may be a more long-term result. It’s really expensive but didn’t break me out. Definitely hydrating and I love the way the little beads dissolve. Just way too expensive for what it is. But I’m reordering to see if it has a more noticeable effect after another few months. 
344610073, On Tonal Scenery Reparative Serum ,Asia,Combination,18-24, I have combination/sensitive skin that loves all the things this product is supposed to deliver however it just left me with tiny whiteheads every time I used it. I will say the texture is a bit thicker than water and it did leave my skin feeling hydrated 
408181067, On Vegan Lactic Acid Emulsion 5% ,Cyndi T.,Oily,45-55," I love this product. I have been using it daily for a month now, and it leaves my skin smooth and soft. I ended up ordering another just in case I ran out. "
408181067, On Vegan Lactic Acid Emulsion 5% ,C,Sensitive,55+," Naturium is my new favorite brand in recent month; however, I had a bad breakout with this one. I have very sensitive, easily irritated skin that is highly reactive unfortunately. It might be the sunflower oil or possibly the lactic acid might be too strong yet difficult to pinpoint. "
197565268, On Soko Glam Collegiate Crewneck Sweatshirt ,Vanessa V.,Dry,25-35," This sweater is definitely oversized, but in a good way. It’s also extremely comfortable and warm! "
197565268, On Soko Glam Collegiate Crewneck Sweatshirt ,Setsuko S.,Combination,25-35," This is a really nice lounge sweater or to throw on in the summer evenings, very cozy but not overly thick. I got my usual unisex size(small) and it’s fits slightly oversized. "
197565268, On Soko Glam Collegiate Crewneck Sweatshirt ,Vanessa,Dry,18-24," I was super excited to receive this sweatshirt, once I got it I washed it and put it on and I LOVE it! It’s so soft, comfortable, it doesn’t shrink when I dry it either. I’ll be honest, I couldn’t take it off. I’m a person who loves to be cozy and comfortable at home and I just really love the quality of the sweater as well. "
197565268, On Soko Glam Collegiate Crewneck Sweatshirt ,Sheanna R.,Normal,18-24, Absolutely love the fit of this sweater. I bought it a size up to have it looser. 
289370012, On Extra Glam ,Cara,Normal,45-55," I took a risk on this product as there were no reviews and no information online. The ingredients looked promising and i had great results with another hair product purchased on soko glam (l’ador wonderbalm). I tried this product 3x and 3 different ways. 1) as a solo leave in product 2) prior to serum 3) with leave in conditioner to amp moisture and air drying. It did nothing- no smoothness, softness, shine, bounce, detangling properties- nada. So unless there is a magic method to using this that evades me, I would pass as it’s not cheap and there are so many great hair products sold elsewhere. "
428419754, On Geumsul Face Cream ,Kate C.,Normal,25-35, Bought these during cyber month and no regrets at all. I love how it leaves my skin glows. Definitely would buy more. 
457624421, On Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner ,Melissa R.,45-54, No," Super soothing, this will forever be a staple in my regimen! "
457624421, On Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner ,Rosselyn O., No,Fine Lines/Wrinkles, Very refreshing 
457624421, On Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner ,Cassandra S.,Other,18-24, Super gentle 
457624421, On Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner ,Ava R.,25-34, No, I love the feel of a face mist to refresh throughout the day but so many products out there are full of fragrance and drying alcohol. This is the only spray I use regularly to calm and freshen my skin. When my skin gets hot and red I will spray some of this onto a cotton pad and use it like a mask. Totally takes the redness away in a few minutes. This is my second time purchasing and will be purchasing again! 
457624421, On Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner ,Isabella S., No,Dull/Uneven Skin, I had a hard time finding a good toner for my skin until I came across this one. It helps with redness and texture as well as moisturizing. 
199005554, On Soko Glam Logo Baseball Cap ,Wes,Combination,25-35," This hat's cute, however, I wish the material was cotton instead of polyester. The cap feels really cheap and flimsy. It feels more like a cap you'd get at a dollar store and for $20, you're essentially paying for the Sokoglam branding. It's a shame because it's really cute, but I can't see it lasting long. It's perfect for bad hair days which is what I'm using it for. "
199005554, On Soko Glam Logo Baseball Cap ,Sophie,Combination,25-35," Not sure why I waited so long to finally buy this, but I am SO glad i did. I love how the material doesn't make your head super hot and give you that forehead sweat, but it's still durable. Perfect for running errands, taking walks, the gym, you name it! This is now a staple for me. "
199005554, On Soko Glam Logo Baseball Cap ,Just M.,Sensitive,55+, I got this as a reward. Color is navy blue as pictured and it is made of nylon. The back is an Velcro band. I would have preferred a metal or plastic type adjustable strap instead hence the deduction of a star. Nice reward but I wouldn’t spend $20 for it. 
199005554, On Soko Glam Logo Baseball Cap ,Kimberly V.,25-35,25-35," The material is soft but feels thin since it’s not a cotton baseball hat. Also, I would have chosen a different font size for the lettering; it’s pretty small. The font on “SOKO” could have been played with too to give it some fun pizazz. "
199005554, On Soko Glam Logo Baseball Cap ,Sara,Sensitive,25-35, Lightweight and breathable - totally love this cap to take with me when I go on hikes! It's really nice quality - maybe the one downside is I feel like it collects lint/hair fairly easily - but I do live with a cat :) 
292938448, On Soonhan Houttuynia Ampoule ,Amanda,Normal,25-35, The ampoule feels very soothing on my skin. I love how my skin feels after using this product. Helps calm my skin. 
292938448, On Soonhan Houttuynia Ampoule ,Kiran,Combination,18-24," Really soothing and moisturizing, not sure if it made a difference with acne though but I think it did "
292938448, On Soonhan Houttuynia Ampoule ,-,Combination,25-35, I love Hanskin! I have yet to find one of their products that doesn't deliver beautiful results. This ampoule is so calming and melts so beautifully into the skin. I tend to use it in my night rotation on days when my skin is a little irritated or dull. I can't wait to try the essence from this line! 
253987087, On Soko Glam Canvas Weekender ,Ashley H.,Sensitive,25-35," I love this bag, it's nice and roomy as well as great quality. It'll be nice to have for those short trips when I don't need to pack much "
6556823, On Beauty Water ,Jacqueline,Sensitive,45-55, This is an awesome product for my dry and extremely sensitive skin for daily exfoliation without any irritation or discomfort. Most chemical exfoliants make me break out in redness and rashes that don’t go away for weeks. It also cleans and hydrates.  
6556823, On Beauty Water ,Jackie,Sensitive,45-55,This is an awesome product for my dry and extremely sensitive skin for daily exfoliation without any irritation or discomfort. Most chemical exfoliants make me break out in redness and rashes that don’t go away for weeks. It also cleans and hydrates. 
6556823, On Beauty Water ,Carrie,Dry,35-44," I have extremely dry and sensitive skin but it still needs to be exfoliated daily especially in the winter because I get a lot of dead skin buildup in those dry months. Harsh chemical treatments can make it worse but Beauty Water gently cleans, hydrates and sloths away the dead layer of skin. It’s also great as a refresher any time of the day.BEAUTY "
6556823, On Beauty Water ,Christine,Combination,25-35,WATER 
6556823, On Beauty Water ,Tess R.,Combination,25-35," I love this cleansing water. It's a great addition to your routine. It's great for the morning refresh when you don't need to wash your face, but you just need a quick cleanse to wash the sleep away and wake up your skin. This cleansing water is very gentle and has a calming effect when you use it. So you immediately feel refreshed and ready to go. "
308904147, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Sheet Mask (1 ea) ,Waneda O.,Sensitive,35-44, This is really nice when you want the essence to really soak into your skin. I use the snail mucin essence daily and love it. 
308904147, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Sheet Mask (1 ea) ,Mariam A.,Normal,25-35, Great mask 
73985179, On Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist ,Stella,Combination,25-35," I love this spray! I started with the toner (also a fave of mine) and decided to try this out. The sprayer is very high quality, and releases a controlled mist to fully cover your face. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft. "
73985179, On Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," I really wanted to love this, but it just didn't work for me. The sprayer was a bit weird and leaky, and I didn't notice any positive effects. "
73985179, On Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist ,Molly,Dry,35-44," This mist is instantly smoothing to my skin, but the spray bottle is just…off. The spray is a super fine mist (good, in my opinion) but doesn’t spray widely enough, so it lands in a specific spot on my face rather than coating the whole face. Not sure if that makes sense, but I end up just putting several sprays/pumps in my hand and then applying that evenly to my face. Still a great product but I don’t end up reaching for it daily. "
73985179, On Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist ,Rianna,Dry,35-44," This is the only product I buy 3 at a time. I keep one in my purse, one at work and one at home. It’s great to even refresh my makeup. The best for my more dry skin. "
73985179, On Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist ,Amy,Oily,18-24," Love the product, didn’t clog and felt nice on the skin. I felt it helped to brighten my skin and moisturize. "
80494440, On Real Vita C Powder Lemon ,itris,Combination,<18, ive never used a powder before 
80494440, On Real Vita C Powder Lemon ,Alexa,Oily,18-24," When mixing this into my toner at night I have found that it makes the toner a little grainy at first unless you sit with it and mix for at least a full minute. While this isn’t a problem for me, sometimes I just don’t have time to mix it in all the way so I don’t use it on those nights. I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who doesn’t have a lot of time to spend on a skincare routine, probably it would be easier to use a liquid vitamin c product. However if you have the time, I think it is definitely worth it. "
80494440, On Real Vita C Powder Lemon ,dipika,Dry,25-35," i had to be careful while applying this power mixing with lotion or toner, i definitely noticed glow in my skin after using it. I have dry skin so, i applied extra moisturizer while using this. "
80494440, On Real Vita C Powder Lemon ,terry,Sensitive,35-44," I didn't see a huge difference on my skin with this. I thought this would work based on all the good reviews, but after I tried a liquid vitamin c serum, I found the liquid vitamin c more effective. Maybe because the powder doesn't really melt even after combining it with a toner, so your skin doesn't absorb it as much. I have sensitive combo skin, acne prone, and my scars heal pretty slow. Maybe the results are quicker for other skin types. "
11965381, On Snail Bee High Content Mask ,Erica J.,Normal,25-35, I bought this after using the snail bee serum for a little mask boost. Perfect! 
11965381, On Snail Bee High Content Mask ,Cait,Sensitive,25-35," This mask leaves my sensitive, acne-prone skin hydrated, plump, and glowy! It did not irritate my skin at all and did not cause any breakouts. I definitely recommend these! "
11965381, On Snail Bee High Content Mask ,Laura,Sensitive,25-35," I struggle with acne and sensitivity. It really hidrates the skin, but gave me a few pimples :( "
11965381, On Snail Bee High Content Mask ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," I have tried A LOT of sheet masks, and this one has been one of my favorites. I probably do this once a week and see very immediate results. Afterwards my skin feels super hydrated, plump and glowing. "
11965381, On Snail Bee High Content Mask ,Sun,Combination,18-24, Made my skin feel super soft and hydrated 
47590735, On Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack ,Camille,Sensitive,25-35, Tres bon masque pour les lèvres! 
47590735, On Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack ,Anna,Dry,18-24, Really nice lip balm/mask that’s thick and moisturizing. The smell was really nice (kind of like caramel). 
47590735, On Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack ,Jay,Combination,25-35," I received this as a Christmas gift and it's the first lip balm where I've seen a tremendous improvement with my lips! My lips are chronically chapped, especially in the winter, but this is the first product I've ever tried that truly keeps them smooth and hydrated. I pile this on at night and my lips remain smooth all day. I can't recommend this enough! "
47590735, On Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35, Does exactly what it’s supposed to. My lips are always chapped but when I wake up in the am after wearing this mask all night my lips are no longer dry. Especially good during the fall and winter when you want to prevent the chappy lips from ever starting 
47590735, On Nourishing Care Lip Sleeping Pack ,Taylor,Sensitive,25-35, I have chronically dry lips that are always chapped. Vaseline didn’t do anything to help. This lip mask is great! I’ve been using it for three weeks now and have seen a noticeable difference. 
492779, On Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream ,Leonor,Dry,<18," I like the consistency of it, it's great for dry skin, it would be great in the winter days "
492779, On Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream ,Teaura M.,Dry,35-44," Nice product, it’s easy to apply not greasy and smell very good 😊 "
492779, On Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream ,AMS,Sensitive,55+," I got a sample of the moistfull collagen eye cream and I have been using it for the last couple of months! It has been fantastic, lightweight and not greasy. I have very sensitive skin with excema and this eye cream works wonders. "
492779, On Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream ,Tanya,Sensitive,25-35," The texture is so lightweight, it feels like I'm rubbing a cloud around my eyes. Out of the 6 products in my nighttime skincare routine, this is my favorite part to apply and the light scent is so refreshing. My skin feels quite hydrated afterwards. I have sensitive skin with eczema, and glad to say that I've been using this for 6 months without any negative reactions! "
492779, On Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream ,Roserita D.,Sensitive,25-35," This eye cream has a light but very moisturizing feeling, with a subtle and fresh scent. I have sensitive skin and eye creams usually break me out, but this has not happened so far! I've only been using it for about a week so I cannot attest to results in wrinkles or tightening, but so far I am loving the creamy texture and moisturizing feeling. After my experience so far, I would buy this eye cream again! "
16689584, On Moistfull Collagen Emulsion ,Kristina T.,Combination,45-55," This is a great emulsion - light but not too watery. However, the smell was so strong reminds me of Avon so badly. And doesn't have that clean of ingredients and can't stop thinking of how unnatural smell is every time I use it. Glad I tried because of collagen but not worth it due to the smell. "
16689584, On Moistfull Collagen Emulsion ,Stardov,Sensitive,18-24,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
16689584, On Moistfull Collagen Emulsion ,Deb509,Combination,<18," This essence is very hydrating, but didn't do much for my skin. Love the cosrx snail mucin essence much better "
16226894, On Moringa Cleansing Balm ,Mandy G.,Combination,35-44, It is a good balm that leaves your skin clean and moisturized. There is a nice smell but very subtle. Would definitely recommend. 
16226894, On Moringa Cleansing Balm ,Jacinta,Sensitive,18-24," such a good product! removes makeup wonderfully, doesn't strip skin, adds moisture. i have sensitive skin and it is so gentle. Has a light, delightful smell, very fresh!! "
16226894, On Moringa Cleansing Balm ,Anaacsts,Combination,25-35," Am I taking advantage of this sale OBVI. Stock up, this cleansing balm is by far one of the best ones. Very faint smell and the texture is pleasing. You won’t regret just do it. "
16226894, On Moringa Cleansing Balm ,Wolf,Combination,25-35, I bought this originally directly from E Nature and now I bought it again from Soko Glam. This stuff smells like heaven and it FEELS like heaven to put on. It's so smooth and soothing. I have acnes prone and sensitive skin and it didn't cause any breakouts or redness. 
16226894, On Moringa Cleansing Balm ,kg,Oily,25-35, i liked it as my first cleansing balm but it became a bit unsanitary and messy for me after losing the scoop that it came with.. i do however keep it around for drunk nights when im sloppy with makeup removal and everything is all over the place so that i dont waste cleansing oil lol 
320422482, On Yuja Niacin Brightening Moisture Gel Cream ,Rachael S.,Combination,35-44," Be careful - a little goes a long way. Has a serum-y texture which is great for oily, acne-prone, or combo skin types. Not sure yet when it comes to effectiveness but wanted to point out how little you need considering it has the same texture as some serums and - generally speaking - aloe vera gel, so it is really lightweight. Which might also make it good for sensitive skin depending on the needs, as some people with sensitive skin want to incorporate Vitamin C into their routine, but also need to stick to lighter layers, or fewer layers of products. I feel with this you might be able to go with a cica or other watery calming serum under such a light gel with fewer problems. "
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Kathy,Combination,18-24, These are the only ones I use. I love how there's two textures to fit your routine. 
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Chona,Sensitive,35-44, I’m a repeat customer of this product. I just loved how effective and efficient it is when it comes to cleansing my sensitive skin. 
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Eleanora S.,Combination,25-35, Super soft and thick! 
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Anh N.,Dry,35-44," Love the two types of cotton pads you get. One I use to wipe things off my face and the other to use with my toner, which makes me use less product too. I always have a backup box. "
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35," Not sure how they came up with these but they’re amazing! They hold the perfect amount of toner and essence so that just a few drops can be applied to your whole face. My product is distributed just as evenly (if not more) than regular cotton pads, but I’m using significantly more product. I’ll never use other cotton pads again "
7333057, On Snail Bee High Content Mask Pack (Box of 10) ,Tara S.,Sensitive,35-44," This is the one product I will never be able to live without! I have super sensitive skin - rosacea, adult acne, dryness, etc. I use these whenever my face is freaking out and it instantly brings relief to all my issues. So soothing and healing! "
7333057, On Snail Bee High Content Mask Pack (Box of 10) ,Chyna,Combination,25-35," These didn't do anything but clog my pores. Maybe they're just not for my skin type, but there are better out there. "
7333057, On Snail Bee High Content Mask Pack (Box of 10) ,Trina D.,Dry,18-24,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry to hear that these masks did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Jerlin H.,Sensitive,25-35, Not too bad but I think the COSRX ones are better for healing acne 
144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Carrie,Oily,25-35, Works well at stopping myself from picking at my skin. 
144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Janet,Combination,18-24," I am a frequent pimple patch user, and have tried multiple brands over the years. Due to this, I know what a 'bad' pimple patch looks like, and the Neogen ones do not fit into that category. Now, I didn't notice anything super special about these as I was using them, but that's ok because they do exactly what I want my pimple patches to do! They have a good stick, and I haven't had any issues with them falling off while I'm wearing them. They soak up my pimple gunk and keep me from picking at them. That's enough for a 5 star review from me! "
144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Anahi R.,Combination,25-35, I am a type that'll try any pimple patches thanks to hormonal acne that gets pustule types of acne. This was a throwaway item that I ordered from last year. It worked fine. Nothing super special and did the job. 
144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35," I am always surprised how well pimple patches work. These have saved me so many times overnight, taking away a blemish like magic. Such a nice thing to have on hand. "
6117191, On Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil ,Jacinta,Sensitive,18-24," Great on my sensitive skin, gets oil plugs out. Is a great way to take off makeup, or use as double cleanser! Great great great product "
6117191, On Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil ,neil,Oily,25-35," Works OK! Have to go in a second time to remove eye makeup, but it works good. "
6117191, On Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil ,Rae,Oily,18-24," I've tried more oil cleansers than I care to list and have been disappointed by them all. This is the only one I've used that doesn't have a strong scent and also doesn't have me wake up with a pimple after using it. I use it in double cleansing and also I've used it by itself and have no problems after use. Also I've noticed I use a lot less than I would other oil cleansers, really one or two pumps of this is all you need. "
6117191, On Gentle Black Deep Cleansing Oil ,Claire,Dry,25-35," I was so excited to try this! I was initially put off by the fragrance, then I noticed my face was red and sensitive for a few days but I wasn't sure which product it was from so I decided to take the actives out of my routine. I used it last night followed by my usual water based cleanser and had red bumps and splotches all over my face. I'm not sure which ingredient I am allergic to but I have read other reviews where people have had similar reactions. I do love the unscented supple preparation toner and that is super gentle and hydrating for my dry skin! "
40855411, On Dermalogy Real Cica Pad ,emma,Sensitive,18-24, i’ve bought these 3 times now and have been using them every morning before toner. great for sensitive and acne prone skin ! 
40855411, On Dermalogy Real Cica Pad ,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35, I love these for refreshing my face in the morning or a little extra exfoliation when I need it. I find them very effective and non-irritating. They feel soothing for my skin. I couldn’t use them on their own as a toner but they’re good as a first step if you don’t want to wash again. 
40855411, On Dermalogy Real Cica Pad ,S,Combination,18-24, full of essence but just feels like I'm wiping my face... not for my taste 
18306331, On Revitalizing Facial Cleansing Foam ,lex,Sensitive,25-35, I have really sensitive skin and I have loved this cleanser. A little goes a long way and using this cleanser AM and PM I still have SO much left after three months of use. It has a soft scent that I find sweet and soothing. 
18306331, On Revitalizing Facial Cleansing Foam ,Reema M.,Dry,25-35," A little how’s a long way! It foams up miraculously, it smells lovely, cleans my skin without drying me up. I’m in love! "
18306331, On Revitalizing Facial Cleansing Foam ,Val,Combination,45-55," I have used this every morning for over a year now. Love it! You don't need to use a lot of the product and the little you use is powerful....rich, cleansing and hydrating. Perfect cleanser that I will use for many more years to come "
18306331, On Revitalizing Facial Cleansing Foam ,Anum A.,Combination,25-35," My favorite cleanser, I’ve bought it 3 times. My skin looks terrible without it. A small amount goes a long way, so the entire bottle can last you 9 months easily. "
18306331, On Revitalizing Facial Cleansing Foam ,Manon,Combination,25-35, I use this as my water based cleanser and it's the only cleanser I've ever used that visibly brightens my skin and lightens my dark spots. 
12898283, On Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream ,emily,Sensitive,25-35," It's currently winter time where most moisturizers feel like they aren't doing enough. I got this one recently and it has been exactly what I was looking for. It's very thick and creamy, but it doesn't feel like it sits on the skin too long after applying like other thick moisturizers. I have extremely sensitive skin, and when I wake up in the morning after using this, it calms a lot of my breakouts and redness, and my skin doesn't have its winter dry patches anymore. Would definitely recommend for others who have dryer skin in the winter, and are looking for a thicker cream to help out. Only thing that wasn't my favorite is the size, it's quite small, but a little does go a very long way. "
12898283, On Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream ,-,Combination,25-35," This was a great moisturizer while it lasted, I can't use it. This cream makes me breakout every time. I tried using it consecutively day and night. Just in the morning, just a night. Even in rotation and it STILL made me break out. This was all over the coarse of a year. I don't blame the product entirely though. Everything I have tried with snail mucin has made me break out. It just doesn't agree with my skin. I have acne prone combination skin and this was not it for me. "
12898283, On Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream ,Arya,Dry,25-35," This cream is so thick that it leaves streaks on your face. I only used it at night because of that. Great for super dry skin! I didn't see any improvement from the snail bee stuff, but that might just be my skin. "
12898283, On Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream ,Ohm B.,Dry,25-35," Benton has a lot of great products but Im not a fan of this one. I would rate this one a 3/5 due to the fact that it is quite think and hard for the product to permeate my skin. I think the ingredients are really nice, but I didn't notice any difference after using the entire tube. "
12898283, On Snail Bee High Content Steam Cream ,Missy,Normal,25-35," I ordered this product after being attracted by strong reviews and interesting ingredients. Unfortunately after a few weeks of use this product has made my skin oily, saggy and I've broken out worse than I have in years.  "
72606921, On Youthful Glow Sugar Mask ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," This mask smells like bubblegum in the nicest possible way. Soothing bubblegum. I don't generally use physical exfoliants on my face anymore, but I can't give this mask up. It's so softening and makes my skin feel absolutely incredible. "
72606921, On Youthful Glow Sugar Mask ,Jacinta,Sensitive,18-24," Very sensitive and dry skin, it helped remove dead skin. Did the job "
72606921, On Youthful Glow Sugar Mask ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," I love it, I use this twice a week or when I’m going out and need to put on makeup. I always put it on as a mask after cleansing and let it sit for 10 min while I do other things. Then I damp my hands and gently rub my face to exfoliate before washing it off. It smells yummy, it doesn’t irritate my skin, and it leaves my skin glowing after I’ve let it sit "
72606921, On Youthful Glow Sugar Mask ,Summer,Combination,25-35, Worked great for my combination skin. 
72606921, On Youthful Glow Sugar Mask ,sahar s.,Combination,18-24, It's just PERFECT! 
73697151, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (Single) ,Alth,Combination,25-35," Nice during a bath after using your actives. Let this seal your treatments in and calm. Skin looks dewier after, perfect everyday mask "
73697151, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (Single) ,rupakarki,Dry,45-55, Feels amazing after application 
73697151, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (Single) ,Ingrid,Sensitive,25-35," I really enjoyed it, and plan to order the 10-pack next time. I also ordered another variety from this brand because I enjoyed this one so much. It's very hydrating and calming for my very dry, rosacea, sensitive skin, and there was a ton of extra essence in the pack, so I've been able to use the extra as an essence step on my face 3 or 4 times now, and still have another use in the pack. It's a worthwhile product! "
73697151, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (Single) ,Jenna,Combination,<18, i was gifted two of these from a friend (not sure if they were ordered on this website) and they left my skin feeling refreshed and hydrated after days spent in the hot sun. i had minor sunburns and they were gone the day after using this mask. 
73697151, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (Single) ,Abigail L.,Combination,18-24," This works amazing after an exfoliation treatment, sunburn, or barrier damage. Aloe and green tea are the one of hardest working duos out there. "
50514549, On Tea Tree Cleansing Water ,Rae,Oily,18-24, I recently changed up my skincare routine and had to change my morning cleanser which was a tea tree oil based one. I need tea tree in my routine to keep my acne at bay so I picked this up on a whim and it has worked wonders. I use with a cotton pad this after cleansing and before applying my serums. It removes the dirt and oil that sticks around after cleansing and just really helps keeps my face clear. Also it doesn't have a strong tea tree scent which is very nice. 
50514549, On Tea Tree Cleansing Water ,Kate,Sensitive,25-35, I love this cleansing water for its multiple uses. It soothes and diminishes my facial 
50514549, On Tea Tree Cleansing Water ,C,Combination,55+,Redness without ever leaving my skin feeling tight or dry. It also has helped my blepharitis due to dry eye as a brilliant eyelid cleaner when I use in morning. I use this now as my stand alone cleanser and takes off makeup just fine. You do have to use a couple of cotton pads but worth it as not super pricey. Please don’t ever stop making this!!! 
50514549, On Tea Tree Cleansing Water ,Suzanne K.,Normal,35-44," Gentle, effective, never stripping, and keeps break outs in check. Doesn’t have any pungent tea tree smell for any nose sensitive. Great as a quick cleanse wipe and/or toner. My skin remains clear with regular daily use. "
50514549, On Tea Tree Cleansing Water ,Vee,Combination,25-35, This is a nice cleansing water but nothing special. It's good as part of a larger skin regimen. 
104208429, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Serum Light ,Caryn A.,Combination,45-55, I had been using another AHA-BHA product for a while and though it was fine. However I could not seem to rid my nose and chin of what I learned was sebaceous filaments. Miracle Serum Light cleared my skin almost instantly and has continued to keep my skin clear. No more little white bumps. Can't recommend this enough! 
104208429, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Serum Light ,Amanda,Combination,35-44, Definitely improves skins appearance over time. It works and it’s gentle on my skin. What else could I ask for? 
104208429, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Serum Light ,Dolly I.,Normal,25-35, Saw results after a week! Definitely recommend 
104208429, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Serum Light ,Iris,Combination,25-35," I usually use a few different kinds of chemical exfoliants one at a time, this isn't my favorite out of the ones I have but sometimes you don't want to carry around a bunch of bottles and this combo serum comes in handy then. "
104208429, On AHA-BHA-PHA 30Days Miracle Serum Light ,Nicole,Combination,<18, Feel so fresh and relaxing on my skin 
89653243, On Collagen Lifting Cream ,Jaida,Combination,35-44, I have combination skin with hormonal acne along my chin & dry skin on my forehead & around my nose. This stuff is the best. It is moisturizing enough without being too emollient for my acne-prone skin. If you have very dry skin this is probably not for you. Not sticky at all & absorbs nicely into my skin. 
89653243, On Collagen Lifting Cream ,Claire,Combination,18-24, This facial cream delivers a lot of collagen directly into your skin. lifting it and making it more radiant. 
89653243, On Collagen Lifting Cream ,Linda O.,Sensitive,55+," I love everything about it, the texture, like a cream gel, the cool, fresh feeling on your skin, the lightness of it and the soft smell. "
89653243, On Collagen Lifting Cream ,Meghan W.,Combination,25-35, I have been using this for a few months and really like it. It didn’t break me out or leave my skin feeling sticky. I would buy it again for sure. 
89653243, On Collagen Lifting Cream ,Sean,Combination,25-35, i used this product daily and found my skin to feel so soft to the touch and didn't leave my skin feeling oily at all 
7176680, On Cranberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,dawn k.,Combination,45-55, I love this n the green tea one! 
7176680, On Cranberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Alyse C.,Normal,35-44," Smells SO good. I loved the green tea version, but wanted to try some of their other ‘flavors’, and this one is great. Only cleanser brand I’ll use. "
7176680, On Cranberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Miki,Sensitive,25-35, Absolutely love the packaging with the cranberries at the bottom. The cranberries are separated from the liquid and not mixed together. Great foam cleanser! Leave your skin clean and fresh. 
7176680, On Cranberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Vinita N.,Combination,45-55, Easy pump and a small dollop is required for a full face cleanse. Love the smell! The texture of your skin is left squeaky clean .and clear . Love it & have ordered more 
7176680, On Cranberry Real Fresh Foam Cleanser ,Ashlee,Combination,25-35, This is my new favorite. I’ve always been skeptical of foam but this comes out as a foam but rubs in almost like a cream. My face feels so good afterwards and it’s been helping clear my skin a lot! 
47451131, On Naked Cotton™ Classic ,Lauren W.,Normal,25-35, These cotton pads never leave lint on my face. I love using these with my toner or micellar water to clean places like my neck and chest when I’m washing my makeup and sunscreen off (without hopping in the shower). Very effective! They can be unfolded as well to spread on the face with an essence as a mask! 
47451131, On Naked Cotton™ Classic ,Jennifer S.,Combination,35-44, I prefer these to any cotton balls I had been using. These cotton pads are simple and what I needed. 
47451131, On Naked Cotton™ Classic ,Angie,Combination,18-24," These are the softest cotton pads I've ever used in my whole life, they feel so gentle on my skin and I don't feel like I'm wasting product. "
47451131, On Naked Cotton™ Classic ,Chanin H.,Oily,35-44," No fuzziness, love them! "
47451131, On Naked Cotton™ Classic ,Amber B.,Combination,35-44, These are great! No fuzz. Texture is good. I like them. 
161994524, On Cica 100 Mask ,Erin L.,Dry,35-44, Love this mask & that it only has one ingredient. 
161994524, On Cica 100 Mask ,Vanessa,Normal,25-35," This was just okay. The moisture was nice and lightweight, probably works better for folks that have oily skin. While it did provide moisture, it didn't leave me dewy the way other masks do. Would probably incorporate as part of routine before work or a special event where I want extra moisture but don't want to look too greasy. "
161994524, On Cica 100 Mask ,Girley,Oily,35-44," I bought this after reading reviews. It took nearly 3 weeks before I received this , so when I used it, my face starts to feel warm, I removed it and I feel itchy but tolerable. The next time used it, I placed it on the fridge for over night before using it, and it feels good. Only 4 for me because I don't like the excess liquid and it drips on my face. I lather the excess, but I still find it annoying. "
161994524, On Cica 100 Mask ,Karen K.,Dry,35-44, I love how hydrating this mask is. It helps with redness. Very refreshing afterwards! 
161994524, On Cica 100 Mask ,Allison R.,Combination,25-35, I love and appreciate that this mask is full of Centella Asiatica - it's so calming and hydrating. Love using at night! 
18970398, On Moistfull Collagen Cream ,Christina,Combination,45-55, It's a nice cream but it's heavy feeling and it has broke me out with acne and the smell stays with you for a long time my face feels oily after I use it but a small amount does go along way 
18970398, On Moistfull Collagen Cream ,Dina P.,Combination,25-35,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
18970398, On Moistfull Collagen Cream ,Elizabeth S.,Oily,25-35," I first tried this moisturizer when I was a teenager experiencing dry skin for the first time. It was the middle of winter and I never felt my skin so dry before. I picked up a jar and my skin was instantly better afterwards. Decided to pick it up again as my skin gets drier and drier, and I fell in love all over again. Great product! "
13053146, On Canadian Clay Pore Cleanser ,Julianna S.,Combination,25-35, Fun mask that helps pull dirt and oil out of my skin. 
13053146, On Canadian Clay Pore Cleanser ,Lauren K.,Combination,<18," Left my skin feel clean, but tight and dry. I like the texture and it is fun to apply, not sure if it actually benefits my skin. I didn't notice a change in my acne from the mask. "
13053146, On Canadian Clay Pore Cleanser ,Kate H.,Combination,18-24,"Thank you for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error and we're sorry that this product did not work for you. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences :) "
188810625, On Green Tangerine Vita C Eye Gel Patch ,Kate,Combination,18-24," Very nice, didn't affect my sensitive skin and hydrated my under eyes. "
188810625, On Green Tangerine Vita C Eye Gel Patch ,SooIn Y.,Combination,25-35," Easily to apply and sticks to skin well. I was it was better packaged inside because the patches got jostled around and are harder to separate, but not a big problem. "
188810625, On Green Tangerine Vita C Eye Gel Patch ,Jennifer C.,Combination,45-55, These are excellent. They give you so many in a single package and they last forever. I bought this several months ago and there's still about half of them left. 
188810625, On Green Tangerine Vita C Eye Gel Patch ,Naomi,Combination,18-24, My eye bags have been pretty bad and these patches are PHENOMENAL!!! My eye puffyness and darkness has reduced so much and my eye has been very hydrated as well!! 
188810625, On Green Tangerine Vita C Eye Gel Patch ,Jen,Combination,35-44, I really enjoy these eye patches!  
17655817, On Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence ,Ella,Dry,18-24, This serum feels so good on the skin and always leaves me looking dewy! 
17655817, On Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence ,Lisa G.,Dry,25-35," This essence came highly recommended, but I don’t know that it entirely lived up to the hype, given the price. I did legitimately enjoy using it. I do think a fair bit of my enjoyment was just due to how bougie the bottle is. If you’re specifically hoping for an essence, maybe look into a different option, as both the packaging (dropper bottle) and texture (not watery) is not conducive to using it as an essence. But in terms of a good moisturizing, soothing serum, this is a fantastic choice because it has the bee trifecta of royal jelly, honey and propolis. I would definitely consider repurchasing next winter. "
17655817, On Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence ,Carlee C.,Dry,25-35, It’s moisturizing and it makes your skin feel soft. I recently bought a lot of skin care so I’m just trying to figure out what step to make it. 
17655817, On Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence ,Addy,Normal,18-24, Amazing Essence does wonders as prep before applying a serum and moisturizer. If you're looking for glowy glass skin then this is for you. 
17655817, On Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence ,Sara,Normal,25-35," Very moisturizing essence, would highly recommend it’s worth the price. Good for normal to dry skin. Also love the packaging. "
81312598, On Dr. Althea Herb Therapy Velvet Mask (10 pack) ,FEY,Combination,18-24, Loved using these after days of wearing makeup felt so nice and made my skin so glowly ! 
81312598, On Dr. Althea Herb Therapy Velvet Mask (10 pack) ,Meg,Combination,25-35," I love these masks. Not only are they soothing to my deep, hormonal acne but in between my cycle when my skin feels dry and parched, they’re also super moisturizing. One of my new favorite masks! "
81312598, On Dr. Althea Herb Therapy Velvet Mask (10 pack) ,Melanie L.,Combination,35-44, One of my go-to face masks! They are very hydrating and moisturising; my skin feels so plump and fresh after using it! I keep buying them over and over. 
81312598, On Dr. Althea Herb Therapy Velvet Mask (10 pack) ,Natalie L.,Combination,25-35," A fitting name for it, these masks feel velvety smooth and therapeutic to my skin, it literally just feels good, and leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, and refreshed. "
19927725, On White Truffle Serum In Oil Drop ,Ariel G.,Combination,35-44, I have not been disappointed with anything Neogen. This is light and not greasy. I add a few drops of vitamin C to it and apply after my Neogen essence. Its moisturizing enough to where I don't need a moisturizer if I'm also wearing sunscreen. Just purchased my 3rd bottle. 
19927725, On White Truffle Serum In Oil Drop ,Kim,Combination,>55, I received this in my ipsy and I never used it for weeks. I finally used it Amazing. My skin drank it i can say my wrinkles have softened and are not so defined. I have to order more of this. 
19927725, On White Truffle Serum In Oil Drop ,Lisa R.,Combination,45-55," 52 and have sensitive skin. This feels great on my face, eyes and lip area. Just started it but know quickly its a winner! "
19927725, On White Truffle Serum In Oil Drop ,NH,Dry,35-44, I use this as part of my nighttime routine. It’s one of my favorite products as it makes my skin very dewy and soft. It also absorbs quickly unlike a typical facial oil that just sits on the surface of your skin. It helps give me glazed donut skin! 
19927725, On White Truffle Serum In Oil Drop ,Anthony H.,Dry,25-35," I purchased this product, as all other oils (like the carrot seed oil) on the website were out of stock at the time, and thought I would give it a try because it sounded interesting. I regret it. It’s not really like an oil at all..which I know it says it’s a “serum in oil”? But it’s not as hydrating as I was hoping and it doesn’t feel like it’s nourishing my skin - which was the reason for this purchase. "
12696967, On BHA Blackhead Power Liquid ,Taya R.,25-34, No," I have used this product about 2 times a week in the evenings, it doesn't hurt my skin and leaves it feeling very smooth, it can be a bit drying but that is expected in this climate here in alberta, Canada. I pair it with the snail 96 mucin which clears up the dryness for me. "
12696967, On BHA Blackhead Power Liquid ,Ruth, No,Other," Both my daughter and I have been using this product for over a month now and we have noticed a significant improvement in our overall skin texture. I have oily skin, and this has definitely helped my face not be oily. And my daughter had really bad blackheads on her nose and now they are barely noticeable. I highly recommend this product. "
12696967, On BHA Blackhead Power Liquid ,Na'ilah S.,Other,25-34, I’ve been using this twice a day for about 3 or 4 days now and Im noticing a difference already. I’m using this on my whole face but the are that needs it most is the apple of the cheek where the pores are largest. It’s clearing and brightening the appearance of the skin. 
12696967, On BHA Blackhead Power Liquid ,Alexus,Normal,25-35," I bought this because I heard that it gets rid of milia (which can only get removed by a professional). I had one or two milia spots for the longest time and after using this product, I just randomly noticed that they were gone! This was really great since it is hard to find products that are specifically meant for milia. I definitely recommend! "
12696967, On BHA Blackhead Power Liquid ,Laurie M.,Combination,18-24, I have been using this product for years I wouldn't be without it‼️💖 
161994529, On H.D.P Photoready Tightening Charcoal Mask (5 pack) ,Amanda,Normal,25-35," Maybe I fell victim to the gimmick, but this mask really seemed to reduce the appearance of my pores. Not drying, and left a nice glow. "
161994529, On H.D.P Photoready Tightening Charcoal Mask (5 pack) ,K.K.,Combination,45-55," I like to use these after a long day out, especially if I wore heavier make up. I feel cleaner (but not dry), tighter, and more refreshed! "
161994529, On H.D.P Photoready Tightening Charcoal Mask (5 pack) ,Sunita B.,Combination,45-55, This is the 3rd type of MEDIHEAL mask I've tried and I'm NOT disappointed! I'm going to do the intensive treatment as recommended on the back of this mask. I like how much essence this product has and love that all you need to do when you remove the mask is to tap the remaining essence into your skin. 
161994529, On H.D.P Photoready Tightening Charcoal Mask (5 pack) ,Tetiana M.,Normal,45-55, Easy to apply and does the job. No stickiness after use. 
136923324, On Soonjung Sheet Mask - Panthensoside ,Lisa,Dry,35-44," This whole line is fantastic. This mask is quite soft, and really great for calming down irritated skin. It's great for dehydration, too -- well, all sheet masks are, but this one really feels like it sinks in, which for my dehydrated skin is *chef's kiss "
136923324, On Soonjung Sheet Mask - Panthensoside ,PAMELA H.,Oily,18-24, I can feel it working. My skin is completely renewed and so soft. I bought more masks but haven't used them all yet. I will definitely reorder. 
136923324, On Soonjung Sheet Mask - Panthensoside ,sarah l.,Dry,25-35, works lovely for dry skin 
136923324, On Soonjung Sheet Mask - Panthensoside ,Nakea,Combination,25-35, I followed the directions for this product exactly and it made my skin so dry. My skin was feeling over worked and sensitive from some breakouts I had so i decided to use this. While I liked the cooling and calming effect it had on my skin. It sucked all the moisture from it. 
86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,Arden S.,Combination,18-24, I have issues with KP (aka: strawberry legs). After using this I have little to no ingrown hairs and my skin is much smoother. I find to also be very hydrating and it is easier to use than the ordinary's lactic acid. 
86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35," I got this b/c I was looking for an aha product to help with my cell turnover. It stung my face first use but only b/c I was using too many actives from other products in combo with this one. I instead use it only 2 or 3 times a week and when I’m not using many other actives, which got rid of the sting. It did exactly what I needed when used this way and consistently. Definitely will buy again! "
86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,Filufilu,Dry,45-55," I got this as a sample with my recent order. I decided to try it out and it's been great. I immediately noticed a difference with my skin. Because my skin tends to be on the dryer side I did use it with a heavy moisturizer. By doing this for my skin, I noticed an immediate difference. I only used it twice a week and I intend to order it once I'm done with my serums. "
86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,AK,Sensitive,25-35, I have sensitive skin so this was my first AHA product whatsoever. After using regularly for a month I did not notice a difference on my skin. It is gentle so no side effects but it did not work for my skin. The gel like consistency glides smoothly on my skin which is nice and gentle. Wouldn't order again. 
86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,Martha C.,Oily,25-35, This stung my face a bit but it works great for my boyfriend. 
7345210, On Snail Bee High Content Essence ,Jade090100,Combination,35-44," I have tried everything for those annoying under eye lines. Let me tell you, please get this. I was even considering Botox but this stuff has made my lines almost disappear after a month. My skin is so soft and firming. And my eyes, omg the skin around my eyes has dropped years. I will be buying this forever. So far, everything I've bought off this site has exceeded expectations! "
7345210, On Snail Bee High Content Essence ,Vinita N.,Combination,45-55," After your regular skin routine ( cleanse and tone ) -- this will be the best feeling you would have when using the concentrated essence . All you need is a pump of it and it just applies smoothly over the areas of concern -- leaving it so soft and supple. I see visible difference within 5 days of use . Amazing enough , I have actually ordered more !! "
7345210, On Snail Bee High Content Essence ,Sara M.,Combination,25-35, This essence is light and really helps with acne scars and uneven skin tone 
7345210, On Snail Bee High Content Essence ,Ahmed,Sensitive,18-24," This is fire, I love using this makes my skin feel so hydrated. I have dry sensitive skin so I'd recommend you use this with a moisturizer. "
7345210, On Snail Bee High Content Essence ,Roland B.,Oily,18-24, After watching Kelly Driscoll hype this the benefits in reduction of acne scarring and hyperpigmentation that this essence provides I had to see for myself. And sure enough it did not disappoint. Hyperpigmentation lightened and little slight not too major acne scars faded a considerable amount. This essence absorbed quickly and nicely and left my skin feeling hydrated and soothed.  
174175610, On Fermentation Mask Pack ,Amanda,Normal,25-35, This mask made my face calmer. The redness I usually see disappeared for a period of time. 
174175610, On Fermentation Mask Pack ,Emma C.,Combination,25-35, Super hydrating and firming. Love this mask 
174175610, On Fermentation Mask Pack ,Chyna,Dry,18-24," Yes yes yes! It's so great, honestly. I use this and I feel young, PLUMP, and fresher that ever! "
174175610, On Fermentation Mask Pack ,sarah,Sensitive,55+, it’s so soothing in the skin i love the toner version nd got after using this lovely hydrating acne fighting 
49183028, On Squeeze Green Watery Sheet Mask ,Julie M.,Combination,18-24, Perfect mask for those summer days when my face needs a refresher!

49183028, On Squeeze Green Watery Sheet Mask ,Becca,Oily,25-35, Love the ingredients in this mask! It's hydrating and left a nice glow on the skin. 
49183028, On Squeeze Green Watery Sheet Mask ,Nina S.,Dry,25-35," I love how lightweight and refreshing this mask is. It is great to use in the morning in cold winter days when my room is dry and it does an excellent job to wake up my skin. It’s a personal preference but I this would not use this as part of my night facial routine, it doesn’t feel rich enough for that. "
49183028, On Squeeze Green Watery Sheet Mask ,Alexis B.,Combination,18-24, This was fun to use and felt really nice on my skin 
49867094, On Tea Tree Scalp Clinic Hair Pack ,Khalid E.,Combination,35-44," Didn't realize when I purchased that this has menthol in it. It has a lot of menthol! If you like the “refreshing feeling”, this may be more suited to you. Maybe I'm tender-headed but the menthol is very strong for me. I have only used it twice so I cannot speak to how effective it is, but so far no adverse effects (except for the potent menthol). "
49867094, On Tea Tree Scalp Clinic Hair Pack ,Cal,Normal,>55,"This product wash out clean and a little bit goes a long way, so it will probably last a long time. "
49867094, On Tea Tree Scalp Clinic Hair Pack ,Jaclyn,Sensitive,18-24,My hair & scalp type: 4C curl pattern; dry and sometimes flaky. 
73787672, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (10 Pack) ,Eloise G.,Dry,45-55, These masks and high quality and leave your skin super hydrated and supple. A must have so glad I tried them. Very calming for sensitive skin. This is my second box. Live them! 
73787672, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (10 Pack) ,Naomi C.,Oily,25-35, Great for my sensitive skin! So hydrating and soothing. My favorite sheet mask 
73787672, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (10 Pack) ,Amalia D.,Dry,45-55, Smelled nice and was soothing on face. 
73787672, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (10 Pack) ,Eber L.,Combination,18-24, when I feel like my skin is going to break out I use this sheet mask to minimize the casualties. 
73787672, On Aloe Soothing Mask Pack (10 Pack) ,Nikki L.,Combination,25-35," It's nice and cooling on the face, as most sheet masks are. It feels refreshing, but I didn't notice much of a difference in my skin after. "
136923250, On Cicaherb Restore Sheet Mask ,Annie,Combination,25-35," I don't consider my skin to be sensitive, so I don't know what in here disagreed with my skin, but I got contact dermatitis the morning after using this. It's my first time ever having such a severe reaction to anything, so I'm stepping away from my regular skin care to take care of this nightmare right now. "
136923250, On Cicaherb Restore Sheet Mask ,Nina,Combination,45-55,"Thanks for your feedback! We understand that skincare is all about trial and error, and I’m sorry to hear that you experienced a reaction to this product. Please know that our team is always available to offer alternative recommendations, suitable to your skin type & preferences. "
136923250, On Cicaherb Restore Sheet Mask ,Stephanie,Dry,35-44, I had a couple of blemishes on my forehead and this mask really helped to soothed down my skin. It left my skin smooth. 
81312394, On Squalane Silk Mask (5 pack) ,Yelizaveta,Dry,35-44," I really enjoyed this mask, it was soft and comfortable and very hydrating for my dry skin. My only concern was the fragrance bothered my allergies. It has a faint fragrance, but I tend to stay away from fragrance due to allergies. If fragrance doesn’t bother you and you have dry skin, I would highly recommend this mask. "
81312394, On Squalane Silk Mask (5 pack) ,Marissa T.,Combination,18-24, These masks are amazing for reviving my skin when I’m traveling and in the winter. There is always a ton of the essence in the pouch too so I feel like I can save a little for later. 
81312394, On Squalane Silk Mask (5 pack) ,K.K.,Oily,18-24," The silk material for the mask is great and was my first time trying something like this. The essence was wonderful too. I've tried several masks from this brand and they've all been great, not surprising that I loved this one too. Would repurchase! "

140850754, On Mugwort Calming Sheet Mask ,M P.,Oily,35-44," This was part of the 10 step skin care routine. I only wish it came with more as a multipack. My skin felt so lush, light, revitalised. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would. Needs to be available as a multipack. "
140850754, On Mugwort Calming Sheet Mask ,Cas,Combination,18-24," got a couple of their masks and they're great, calmed my skin down "
140850754, On Mugwort Calming Sheet Mask ,sarah,Dry,18-24, i always make sure to get these as they are so so soothing and calming on my skin !!! 
140850754, On Mugwort Calming Sheet Mask ,Sarah,Dry,18-24, helped calm my skin down but not a dramatic difference !! 
136923257, On I'm Pure Cica Suncream ,iris,Combination,<18, Im satisfied with the texture. 
136923257, On I'm Pure Cica Suncream ,Waneda O.,Sensitive,35-44, Received this as a gift and really like that it’s full size! Goes on nice and doesn’t leave a residue like some other spf formulas. I definitely feel protected with 50spf! 
136923257, On I'm Pure Cica Suncream ,Becca,Sensitive,25-35, Sensitive eyes are my number one concern with sunscreen and this one causes absolutely no irritation and rubs in clear. The matte finish holds up even over the summer in midwest humidity. It has a slight smell that disappears on application. Just repurchased. 
136923257, On I'm Pure Cica Suncream ,Ariel,Sensitive,25-35, The smell of this stuff is SO GROSS. It smells exactly like sour milk and I cannot figure out why. It also feels really sticky on my face and never totally absorbs. I gave it two stars instead of 1 because at least it's not drying? 
7345225, On Organic Cotton Treatment Toning Pad ,Peyton M.,Oily,25-35, I was skeptical when I opened the jar because I thought the individual wipes looked strange and the aroma a bit funky. I’m really glad I bought these though because after using the cotton pads my skin felt clean and toned. Only suggestion I have is to use two cotton pads per cleanse instead of the one. Other than that I highly recommend this product. 
7345225, On Organic Cotton Treatment Toning Pad ,Laurie,Combination,55+, I have tried several samples and really want to order this product but it has been out of stock for so long. I receive 15 % off coupons to use that expires in 30 days. I have wanted to order all summer but still out of stock. UGH!! 
7345225, On Organic Cotton Treatment Toning Pad ,Mel,Combination,35-44, I reaaaallllyyy love this toner. Please make this one available soon 🙌 
7345225, On Organic Cotton Treatment Toning Pad ,brittany,Dry,25-35," I am excitedly anticipating the restock of this product. I received these cotton pads as a sample with my purchase and it does exactly what it claims. It's amazing how much can still be left on the skin after double cleansing. This product helped me understand the value of using toner, especially toner that is gentle enough for my skin. Please restock soon! "
7345225, On Organic Cotton Treatment Toning Pad ,Maria,Combination,35-44," I do not like these. Got as a sample. I just used one after my shower, my face felt sticky, so I waited a minute, then put my normal lightweight moisturizer on top. My face was so tacky! I tried to just bear it but after an hour, in addition to having a sticky face, it was now shiny too. I couldn’t tolerate it. I had to rewash my face. I gave it two stars though because I did like the dual sided pad. "
