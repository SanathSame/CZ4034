10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Shelby P.,Combination,18-24, All products seem to work ," All products seem to work good, but the serum and essence leave a sticky or tacky feeling on my face after. "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Dana K.,Normal,25-35, Does wonders for your skin ," Have honestly only used this set so far for three days, but can already see the difference in my skin's overall appearance. Definitely a well curated set for normal skin types! "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Rachel,Normal,18-24, Great Intro Skincare Set , I must admit to slacking on my skincare this past year. So I decided to get back into this month with a designated routine. This set is amazing for those with Normal Skin. I seriously cannot love the oil cleansing pads enough! They are my favorite product in this set. My skin has no reaction to them and just feels amazingly clean afterwards. PRO TIP: Take a page straight out of Charlotte Cho's Book and massage your face at this point before rinsing it off. Literally the reason why it's my favorite step.  
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,CatTate,Normal,45-55, Love this system ,"The Egg-Zyme cleanser is the only product I'm debating on switching out. (Routines are not a one size fits all and I knew going in I might have to swap out a product or two). This cleanser just makes my face feel SQUEAKY clean but a bit too tight. It also has a slight small that some may find irritating on the skin. They clay mask also feels good. If you've tried the Aztec clay mask that was trendy, this has a similar feel.  "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Amanda A.,Normal,18-24, Good but one of my products got swapped ,"I love the Toner Pads, but I might be biased due to the Vitamin C and its smell. The Essence and Serum are nice -- but might swap them out for another product only to pick one that's targeted for a specific skin concern. And it's hard not to love a good sheet mask but I feel like you can swap for a cute face mask if you want.  "
10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Ana V.,Combination,18-24, great for beginners! ," I would recommend this kit for anyone that doesn't really know how to start a Korean skin care regime. all of the products are very high quality and I immediately noticed a difference in my skin texture! my only complaint would be that this kit only comes with one face mask, I was hoping for a set of five or ten.

10232026, On 10-Step Korean Skin Care Routine Set (Normal Skin Type) ,Mei,Dry,25-35, I started breaking out ," I am so moisturized than ever before! I feel really good about myself. Downside is, it may be just because of my skin, but as soon as started using the set, I noticed redness spots on my face. I noticed my pores on my cheeks are getting bigger.

3841317, On 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine Set (Combination Skin Type) ,Janelle,Combination,18-24, Great EXCEPT the toner ," I've bought skincare from SokoGlam since 2016, I love their products. I typically buy oily skincare sets. This time I decided to try a combo skin set because not all of my face is oily, and some spots are sensitive/prone to redness. This set it great EXCEPT for the toner. It feels like acid on my skin. I've only used it twice. I don't blame SokoGlam for this, but I would like a recommendation to a different toner that could work with this set considering I spent over $200. So, if you have sensitive skin, or skin that just isn't tough, this toner will take you out! "
3841317, On 10-Step Korean Skincare Routine Set (Combination Skin Type) ,Shierly,Combination,18-24, Not a fans of Saturday Skin clarifying toner , I've bough the 10 steps skin care in this online shop 2/ 3 years ago and it works like magic.

248635316, On 1025 Dokdo Toner ,Anna,Sensitive,18-24, THERE'S A REASON WHY IT'S OUT OF STOCK! ," This is amazing for anyone who just wants simple hydration and the feeling of clean skin. It WON'T do anything magical since it has no additional actives like AHAs or Vitamin C. However, the peace of mind it gives me that I won't break out and get a reaction to using this toner is enough for me. Great for people suffering from red, painful, cystic acne or anyone who doesn't like the water quality of where they live and want a second cleanse. "

Whenever I feel there's gonna be a spot about to appear, I immediately apply the oil on using my finger, and it felt better the next morning. The swell lessens and it hurt less. I think using Q-tip to apply the oil works, but it absorb too much product so I just use my finger instead. Since it's oil, it has this potent smell but I don't mind it.  "

24638937, On 5-Step Anti-Aging Set ,Alth,Sensitive,45-55, Love this set ,I only give this a 4 as the serum says to use sunscreen SPF 30+ but the kit does not come with it.

Not only is it a great price for how much product you get, but it's always a great formula. There's a slight grainy texture when you first squeeze the product into your hands, but I find once you start working it into your skin you can't really feel it anymore.

144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Janet,Combination,18-24, It's a Good Pimple Patch ," I am a frequent pimple patch user, and have tried multiple brands over the years. Due to this, I know what a 'bad' pimple patch looks like, and the Neogen ones do not fit into that category. Now, I didn't notice anything super special about these as I was using them, but that's ok because they do exactly what I want my pimple patches to do! They have a good stick, and I haven't had any issues with them falling off while I'm wearing them. They soak up my pimple gunk and keep me from picking at them. That's enough for a 5 star review from me! "
144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Anahi R.,Combination,25-35, They're Fine , I am a type that'll try any pimple patches thanks to hormonal acne that gets pustule types of acne.

144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,paige,Combination,25-35, Great protection and stick ," I've tried most brands of pimple patches but I keep coming back to this one.

Both get 5 stars from me. "
144338861, On A-Clear Soothing Clear Spot Patch ,Sarah,Dry,18-24, BEST pimple patches , pimple patches tend to often be expensive or not that effective; this one however was very much cheaper than other pimple patches and will heal my pimples in just 6 hrs!!!

144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,Linda L.,Dry,35-44, Not soothing at first , I guess I'm a little sensitive to the threaded side. It slightly irritates my skin when I'm gently wiping but the embossed side feels really nice. I think I'll avoid exfoliating pads going forward.

144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,Laura M.,Sensitive,25-35, love it ," Why didn't I find out earlier? It has helped me a lot with acne. The smell is a bit strong, but it's ok. "
144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,Leah,Oily,45-55, Great for sensitive/acne prone skin ," These are the only pads that have worked to control my daughter‚Äôs hormonal acne. I cut one in half because the pads are huge and have so much serum in them. Amazing ingredients like salicylic acid & tea tree oil (for acne) licorice root extract, camellia leaf extract, aloe leaf and calendula extract (for soothing) . It also has moisturizing ingredients, so it won‚Äôt dry out the skin. My son and I use these pads too and love them. I highly recommend these all in one pads! "
144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,Kylie D.,Combination,35-44, Love these so much , I normally hate how exfoliating feels but I love the two sided pads and just how much product is on each of the pads. Already came back to buy a back up 
144338747, On A-Clear Soothing Essence Pad ,Solea,Combination,25-35, Great for a morning cleanse! , I like to use these pads for when I don't use a face cleanser in the morning. This does a good job of cleaning my skin without stripping it and leaving it feeling semi hydrated on its own. Still need to put on a moisturizer after though.

Only thing is when I apply it to my face and I forget it's there, it sucks being in public fully unaware of pink dots on your face. Lol. One feedback though, the ratio of the pink stuff compared to the clear liquid should be adjusted in my opinion. I always run out of the clear liquid first before the pink stuff and have to toss the whole bottle away since it is too dry to use the pink stuff without the clear liquid. "

I was really excited to use this because I'm going through a flare up of hormonal acne and my pores are looking rough since the summer months are coming up where I live and it's humid. I love the way my skin looks after using this mask, I can't use it everywhere unfortunately because it burns really badly on my cheeks and forehead but the parts I can use it on when it's removed look so flawless. My complexion is even and the acne, while it isn't gone, is certainly dulled down significantly considering a single use. My second time using it I did decide to sleep in it to see if time made a difference and leaving it on overnight on problematic areas was beneficial. I asked a question about the sensitivity on here and support was very quick to get in touch with me and they were extremely kind. I couldn't return the product due to a site error and they helped me find an alternative mask for sensitive skin types, guided me on continuing to use this mask since I did like it's results and even gave me a gift card for the site issue/skin reaction which wasn't necessary but very kind of them.

I have dry curly hair, and it was softer, shinier, less frizzy, with more defined curls. I used it again with the same result. By then I was running low so I decided to save it for a special occasion. Used it again after 2 months and again no big difference but after using it again the next day I had shampoo commercial hair. Concluded that it takes a couple of tries to take full effect, but worth it once it does. Recommend buying two bottles "

I actually use it in the morning to add extra plump and hydration to my skin. This is one of the rare products I don't get reactive redness with. I don't really like the texture on my hands but once it's set into my skin, I like the way it makes my skin feel. I plan to try the cream with it next. "

308904052, On Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Nancy H.,Combination,18-24, Packaging issue not product issue , The second lid/ inner lid was really hard to pop / pull off. The product itself is great- but not if sure I will get again or if it‚Äôs even worth it due to how difficult it was to get the lid off. 
308904052, On Advanced Snail Hydrogel Eye Patch ,Goldie C.,Dry,18-24, Soothing & Hydrating , -1 star because opening the lid is a pain. I had to pry it off with tweezers after breaking the plastic cover because it would not budge (maybe too much mucin suction?).

308904143, On Advanced Snail Mucin Power Gel Cleanser ,Olivia, No,Loss of Firmness, Love it! , I‚Äôve been using this cleanser for about a year now and it is by far my favorite I‚Äôve used. When I started I immediately noticed an improvement in the softness of my skin and I no longer worry about roughness or bumpiness (though these were admittedly not my biggest concerns). I don‚Äôt mind the fragrance since it‚Äôs a cleanser and not a moisturizer. It is often the second step of my double cleanse after the DHC Deep Cleansing Oil but it can definitely stand on its own.

308904184, On Advanced Snail Peptide Eye Cream ,Ashley,Dry,35-44," For sensitive eyes, a must! "," My eyes are super sensitive, the wrong eye cream has made my eyes super red, itchy and inflamed in the past so to say I was hesitant to use this is an under statement. But the reviews saying this is great for sensitive eyes were right! The formula for this is super light, silky, and melts right in. I can also tell such a difference on my under eyes. I don't know how it did it, but my eyes just seem less puffier and dark, I look well rested in the morning! This is finally an eye cream I can commit myself to using every night with no negative draw backs - I can't stress it enough to give it a try! "
212912621, On Agas ACue Cleansing Foam ,Hailee C.,Oily,No, Fights Acne and Soothing! ," This cleanser works great with my skin. Since I started using it, I‚Äôve noticed my breakouts have decreased significantly and it doesn‚Äôt dry or strip the skin to where it feels uncomfortable, but I still feel like I get that ‚Äúclean‚Äù feeling from it. "
212912621, On Agas ACue Cleansing Foam ,Alondra M.,No,25-35, Holy Grail , I used it along with the pore cleansing oil pha and it got rid of most of my grail on my forehead. My forehead has never been this smooth before! I LOVE IT!!! 
212912621, On Agas ACue Cleansing Foam ,Kelli,18-24,Combination, Wanted to love- tried with high hopes , I‚Äôm struggling to find a new cleanser ever since acwell changed their bubble free cleanser. I had high hopes for this- but it failed me. It‚Äôs just too strong for my skin This irritated my sensitive skin and caused redness and dry irritation. 
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Nantana R.,Combination,45-55, Strong perfume for my personal taste , It has a nice texture and easy to absorb on my face. But the scent is quick strong for my liking. 
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Karen C.,Dry,25-35, A nice moisturizer ," I bought this moisturizer for the humid DC summertime and have enjoyed it so far. It goes on light and absorbs quick, which is nice when I want to put it on and go to sleep. However, for the price, I won't be replacing the pot once it's over -- it's does its job but doesn't blow my mind. "
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Stephanie,Combination,25-35, Great Moisturizer That Doesn't Feel Oily ," I have been using this for several months, and it's a great moisturizer if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin. I was dealing with some hormonal acne just on my chin (normal skin type on rest of my face), and this leaves my skin hydrated without causing breakouts. I also have pretty sensitive skin and this is gentle with no harsh components. It has a slightly stretchy texture, but smells nice and a little goes a long way. I'm on my third jar of it, and would definitely recommend it for people with oily or combination or sensitive skin. "
161994551, On Agas ACue Cream ,Tiffany,Combination,25-35, Nice But Kind of Sticky , I like the way my skin feels after I use this. I have oily skin so this moisturizes my skin without making it greasy. There are 2 draw backs for me. One was the fact that it feels sticky as if you're putting glue on you face. The second was the smell. It's not super strong but I'm not a fan of the scent. 
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Paige,Combination,35-44, Wanted to love it... ," I did not look at the photo of the mask above, and was very surprised by the herbs-in-goo consistency when I first opened it. (That was my bad, so no points docked there... Just suggesting that you check the pic yourself!) It's kinda messy to apply and it kinda feels like it's going to slide off my face. Also: when I washed it off I always get nervous that all the leafy bits are going to clog my sink.  "
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Elisabeth R.,Combination,18-24, Soothing but strange ,"Ignoring all that, I still just don't love the product. Perhaps my skin type (combination, a little acne prone, minor redness, not very sensitive) isn't the target market and that's why I didn't see or feel any difference. I'll use up this mask because it doesn't negatively effect my skin, but I won't be repurchasing either. "
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Sozo,Oily,35-44, Calming Results ASAP ," I would highly recommend this product. It has a nice tea/herbal smell to it and is not offensive at all. There is no added fragrance, the smell comes straight from the herbs within the mask. I have sensitive, somewhat oily skin and this product is very soothing and calming and definitely helps with redness. It leaves my face feeling smooth, calm and happy. I have used it several times and still have a lot left, so it is definitely worth the price. If you have concerns with sensitivity and redness, I highly recommend this product. I will say though, application and washing off can be quite messy due to the watery and herbal nature of this mask. "
161994566, On Agas ACue Herbal Mask ,Cristina R.,Combination,18-24, Like a cup of tea for your face ," Smells and feels great. It‚Äôs a bit messier than I expected ‚Äî it‚Äôs really just bits of leaf in gel. It doesn‚Äôt dry or stiffen such as other masks I‚Äôve used. It remains wet until I wash it off. So, I‚Äôm not sure how much it‚Äôs really pulling out of my skin, or how much exfoliating or purifying it does. However, my skin looks nice and feels nice and soft post-rinse, and following it up with toner/essence/vitamin c is producing a nice, even result and my pores and rosacea seem reduced. Overall, it doesn‚Äôt HURT my skin, and anything that doesn‚Äôt make me break out is a win. However, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs really scrubbed, purified, or improved it the way I would expect a mask to. "

I have never had so much serum, and I only use about three droplets to cover my face each night. I am glad I took the risk because I'm sure this will last me a long time even with nightly use (which it is gentle enough for). There is a light clean scent but it hasn't bothered me "

308904238, On AHA/BHA Refresh Vitamin C Booster Serum ,Tammy,Combination,25-35, , I hate putting a poor review but I purchased this because of the decent reviews and I was in the market of looking for a new vitamin c serum. When I went to open this I noticed on the bottle label it said ‚ÄúCautions: people with allergy to aspirin will react poorly to the betaine one salicylate.‚Äù No where on this product page does it say that. I decided to put a little drop on the back of my hand to see if it‚Äôll be okay and needless to say I definitely felt a burning sensation followed with an itch.

I have extremely sensitive skin and a lot of allergies so I always cross check my products. There should have been nothing that affected me in this.

I also really like that it stays dewy looking, so it looks great over dry patches. I've worn it a few times and it's lasted all day each time, I didn't need to touch up. If you're wearing a mask or sweating a lot you may need to though, although I think it would be easy to add more with this formula. It's also very buildable! "

This serum feels nice on the skin, is fragrance-free, and is non-irritating. However, I haven‚Äôt noticed any benefits to my skin claimed. This product definitely doesn‚Äôt deliver the same results as an actual vitamin C serum, and the niacinamide in it I know is good for skin but I haven‚Äôt really noticed any effects from that either. This product is akin to putting on a water gel to my skin and that‚Äôs it. I also want to note that this product doesn‚Äôt tell you the concentration of niacinamide so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very much and that may be why I haven‚Äôt seen much benefit.

251150253, On Carrot + Niacinamide Moisturizing Cream ,Ellemarieg,Oily,35-44, Will definitely continue to purchase ," I've been using this for about six weeks now. I'm not sure if it's using this alone, nightly, or that I've been also taking a collagen hydration supplement, but my skin has been looking so much better than it has in the past. I have very oily skin--like oil-slick within an hour of washing oily. It's also ""oily but dehydrated"" which means I have to use a combo of lightweight hydrating products with mattifying ones. Because of all of this my pores are very prominent. (I used to get called strawberry nose when I was younger.) My texture issues have improved so, so much since using this, so much so, that I feel more confident than I ever have to go without makeup. I think it has a mild retinol-like effect because carrots are high in vitamin A, and retinol is essentially topical vitamin A. As I said, I use it at night directly on the skin, no serums before, just an exfoliating LHA toner before, that I put on with a cotton pad. I realized after the first two tries that I need to then layer a mix of two drops of oil plus a hyaluronic acid serum on top, followed by a layer of a very, very lightweight moisturizer. Misting something watery like a witch hazel between layers also helps. If you've been struggling with texture issues, but have been hesitant to use anything retinol like, I think this is worth a try.

340463387, On CC Water ,Amy,Combination,55+, So light and smooth , I don't wear makeup and I wanted something just to make my skin even this is perfect it's very light feels like I don't have anything on my skin and takes away all of the uneven skin tones 
340463387, On CC Water ,Rachel L.,Sensitive,45-55, Not As Expected , I wanted something to replace my IT Cosmetics CC Cream. This was not it ‚Ä¶ The coverage is so light. It may (or may not - I really couldn‚Äôt tell) even out skin tone but that is about it.

457624421, On Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner ,Lauren,Fine Lines/Wrinkles,35-44, Soothing and refreshing ," I love facial mists, and I use them very flexibly in my routine (sometimes first, sometimes last). This toner is gentle and refreshing, I really like it. The only thing is, the spray is very intense like soaks my whole face in liquid with one pump...which I guess is great for product longevity! "
457624421, On Centella Water Alcohol-Free Toner ,Huy T.,Dry,18-24, Super gentle and soothing ," I got this product on Amazon and I got to say, I love it! The water is very gentle and doesn't sting my face or neck. I use this everyday, morning and night, and especially when my face is inflamed by some other products or actives. I like that it comes with a spray that allows me to easily cover a wide area without having to manually rub to spread the liquid. This product has a refreshing scent but is not overly fragranced. I think the scent comes from the Centella asiatica leaf water and not some essential oil so I think it is safe for people with sensitive skin to use. Overall, I would purchase this product again. "

358279147, On Chasin' Rabbits Aloe U Vera Much Soothing Gel ,hillary,Oily,25-35, Beautiful product! ," I bought this to use as a conductive gel for my microcurrent device and it works exceptionally well! I like this so much more than the gels that come with the device. It‚Äôs a beautiful simple formula with great ingredients. Four stars because it dries down sliiiightly sticky and remains a bit sticky for a while. But overall, lovely and lightweight product for added hydration! "
253722813, On Chasin' Rabbits Limited Edition Set ,Nicole,Combination,25-35, New holy grail? ," I've been using this set for a couple of days now and so far I am LOVING it! Usually, I have a pretty oily T-Zone, but since it's been getting colder, my skin has been so dry it was literally flaking off. I've been using this set morning and night and it doesn't leave my skin feeling tight like my last cleanser. I like that this leaves my skin feeling and looking hydrated all day. I think I am going to find something a little more intensive for night moisturizer. I'm giving it 4-stars because I will have to keep using it to see how it really affects my skin after longer use, but if it continues the way it is, it's an easy 5-star set! Also the little bag and stickers are such a cute touch and I love the headband, it fits very well without being too tight. "
253722813, On Chasin' Rabbits Limited Edition Set ,Rachel L.,Dry,45-55, Great Products (!) ‚Ä¶ BUT ," I love these products so I decided to buy myself this gift set. I am a little disappointed. I should have just saved the extra money and bought the 3 full sized products separately. The bag and headband is not worth the extra $10. The headband is small and keeps popping off my head (I just have an average sized head!) The bag is what the products were packed in and it has writing about the products all over it. That makes it a little awkward, imo. "
253722813, On Chasin' Rabbits Limited Edition Set ,Kylie J.,Dry,25-35, Awesome ,"If you want to make your own set, I suggest you just buy all 3 separate products and the adorable and functional $5 headband from Etude House. "

356394898, On Chasin‚Äô Rabbits Drunken Hand Pomade ,Jennifer S.,Combination,35-44, Love smell and hydrates pretty well ," I like using this morning and night when I am also applying my cuticle oil. It does have a temporary greasy feel but I always apply onto back of my hands and rum in most of it before getting on my palms. Any extra greasy feeling I rub my palms into my elbows and it‚Äôs all good. I did struggle with the packaging when opening, foil came off but left a layer of plastic I didn‚Äôt notice and thought it was just extremely hard to push from tube. Until I checked it again and got the rest of the plastic removed! "
356394898, On Chasin‚Äô Rabbits Drunken Hand Pomade ,Anna,Dry,18-24, Smells so good and feels like it's actually doing something for my hands... , I love how it smells (sweet mangoes with a hint of herbs so it's not TOO sweet) and how thick it is. It's definitely not for people who want a thin consistency but it melts beautifully in your hands and doesn't leave a sticky feeling at all. Everyone always compliments the scent and asks for a bit! 
356394898, On Chasin‚Äô Rabbits Drunken Hand Pomade ,neil,Dry,25-35, Such a relaxing scent! ," Wow, I purchased this during the black Friday sale as a treat to myself, and wow!

49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,Erica S.,Combination,25-35, Subtle glow ," Great daytime moisturizer. Seems to help sebum production, skin soothing, doesn‚Äôt irritate acne, and leaves a beautiful finish to my skin. If you have some dry spots like me, you may want a heavier moisturizer to spot treat or use overnight. Perfect during the day, even in the hot summer. "
49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,jeffery a.,Combination,25-35, Sheeeesh , From now on my go to moisturizer for hot / Florida humid weather. Got this recommended from one of their employees via direct email. My skin honestly doesn‚Äôt produce as much sebum anymore. It‚Äôs light and instantly sinks in. Seems small but you honestly only need a dime amount! I combine this with my green tea fresh toner and adore them both together. Haven‚Äôt had a breakout in 2 weeks. Diet still bad tho haha 
49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,Georgia R.,Combination,25-35, Distinctive smell , Not sure this is going to work for me. I was looking for a light moisturizer I can wear in the winter because my regular gel moisturizer isn't cutting it. I like the texture and it feels great at night when I put it on. 
49905066, On Chok Chok Green Tea Watery Cream ,Alex,Combination,18-24, Favorite! ,"However, I am breaking out more along my jaw and around my mouth. I think this cream and regularly wearing a mask is too much for my skin.  "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Briar,Dry,25-35, Just okay. ," I‚Äôm almost finished with the bottle. I have dry, sensitive skin tendencies. I wash my face and then follow with this before applying a prescription retinoid or the occasional AHA at night. It‚Äôs liquid, almost a soft water like consistency. Someone mentioned the bottle being convenient and I would agree with that. The valve on top acts as a good portion control. The product itself is just okay (especially for the price). There are definitely more effective products out there. It does have soothing qualities but even that I find to just be kind of meh. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,pikapop,Dry,35-44, Saves my skin ," I have sensitive skin that gets red easily but with this stuff, it calms my skin and the itchiness disappears fast. I use it morning and night and notice it does help other products sink into my skin better. Cica is a skin saver "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Bunny,Sensitive,25-35, Great , This product is great. I do not break out as often as I did since I started to use this product.  
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Marlena A.,Sensitive,25-35, Finally ," I have to say, the design of the bottle is great. When I tip it over, not a lot comes out. Just a good amount . I tap 2-3 times and it is enough for my entire face. I like this a lot because for other products, I tap once and a lot comes out. this is totally worth it. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Luanda L.,Sensitive,25-35, SMOOTHIE ," I have very sensitive skin--Why? Simply because I use prescription Retin- A every night--which is amazing---but it destroys the skin barrier. So, I am using this Cica Essence and LOVING IT!!! "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Jocelyn,Normal,25-35, Toner / Essence ? ," This essence is the first essence I've used so I don't have much experience with it, but this definitely feels like a toner. I treat it like a toner in that this is the first product I'm putting on my face after I've washed it. I haven't had any bad reactions, and it does feel soothing, especially after long days of wearing makeup or being in the sun. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Candice B.,Sensitive,25-35, Calming Hydrator ," When my skin is feeling sensitive this is one of the products I reach for. It's got a thin/watery consistency so I usually use it as a toner, let it dry down, then pat it on like an essence. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Aly,Combination,25-35, GAME CHANGER! ," So I may have chemically burnt my skin from another product that was packed with harsh ingredients. I needed to repair my skin barrier again and this cica essence completely changed it. I had to quit all my actives and was hyper focused on getting the moisture in my skin. This essence helped when accompanied after a toner and before a moisturizer for me. It is a watery consistency and the bottle itself is simple. I would say the top may over-pour if you‚Äôre not careful. Also patting it down and not rubbing it in helps. Overall, Dewy Tree is a great brand and I switched over to their face wash when I bought this one. The combination of both helped me get away from those chemical burns from another product in about a week. "
208519406, On Cica 100 Essence ,Desirae,Combination,25-35, Hydraglow! , I am obsessed with this! I never knew how much I needed essence in my routine. My skin soaks in all of the goodness and leaves it super dewy without looking oily. This has solved my dry skin problem!

247391711, On Clean Forever Young Biome Ampoule ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35, So surprised how well this works ," This has definitely made it into my daily routine. I was a little skeptical at first because the texture is a little odd and thick. But it absorbs very well and leaves the skin feeling hydrated but not sticky. Instantly I noticed my skin was calmer, hydrated and more firm. Additionally, I noticed that some dry spots on my face pretty much went away instantly. Couldn‚Äôt recommend more. "
247391711, On Clean Forever Young Biome Ampoule ,Janet M.,Normal,25-35, Wonderful product ," I am new to rover in, in fact I had never heard of it. Frankly, I think they have some of the best products out there. I had persistent eczema on my ear and using Rovectin products has completely eliminated it. The bombe is like a serum, I use it like one. There is absolutely no smell and it absorbs easily in the skin. Together with the cream my skin is very smooth and looks great. And the price is right too. Everything is so superior to the expensive products that I have been using from another high end brand. Finally, great skin and yet no greasy feel. "

417252308, On Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening ,Stella,Combination,25-35, Doesn't rinse off ," I bought this hoping it would be an affordable option comparable to the Then I Met You cleansing balm, but it did not live up to my expectations. I agree with the other review that says it's hard to rinse off. It doesn't really emulsify well, and then it will not rinse off. It just becomes sticky and greasy. I'm using way more of my gel-cleanser trying to scrub this off. "
417252308, On Clean it Zero Cleansing Balm Brightening ,LL,Combination,25-35," Smells fine, works alright ","On the plus side, it did not irritate my very sensitive skin. Even when it was hard to clean off, it didn't irritate my skin or clog my pores. "

49735559, On Clean It Zero Cleansing Balm Nourishing ,SDB,Dry,35-44, Oddly Drying ," I feel like I'm probably in the minority, but this really dried my skin out! I used it from late spring until mid-Aug and found myself having to moisturize like it was mid-winter. Normally, I don't have as many issues with dryness in the summer months. I'm pretty certain that the issue stemmed from this, as it was the only variant/new product in my routine. I used it up, so I feel like I gave it enough time - just wasn't for me! As soon as I moved a different product into the cleansing oil/balm step, my skin was back to normal. It's not awful or anything, just maybe not for every type of dry skin! "

You‚Äôre supposed to add it dry to the face and then add water to wash it off, but I was adding the water first so it was not as effective.

You don't need a lot of product so it lasts 4-6 months+ easy, and it's a lot less messy than a plain oil to work with, which is why I tried it in the first place! I like to put it on before I jump into the shower and then rinse it off there to keep my routine simple (I can't be the only one who hates to wash their face at sinks, right?) "

320422043, On Clean Lotus Water Calming Sheet Mask ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35, Hugs your skin so well ," I really liked this mask, unlike any sheet mask I have done. The texture is slightly gelatinous, but it really sticks to your skin. There is a lot of liquid in the package too. Overall, both of these aspects definitely meant I could tell my skin was very hydrated afterwards. Definitely will buy again! "
320422043, On Clean Lotus Water Calming Sheet Mask ,Jennifer C.,Combination,45-55, Ab Fab , Absolutely fabulous sheet masks. They fit perfectly and work incredibly well.

I haven't tried one I haven't liked fro Soko Glam. I really gravitate towards the sheet masks that don't have so much fragrance, mineral oil, and in general are hydrating and very gentle - a really good one to try for dehydrated skin this winter! "

235840375, On Cleanse Me Softly Milk Cleanser ,JesSkin,Combination,No, Great morning Milk cleanser ," This has been such a great milk cleanser for me during the start of the cold/winter season. My skin usually gets incredibly dry once there is any signs of the cold coming in and this has been such a great morning cleanser, soft, gentle, non irritating for my sensitive skin! As i've gotten older I've become sensitive to a lot of artifical/scents, but I found this line refreshing as the natural light scents are herbal/tea like and actually pleasant. I have the whole Sioris line, I use it for morning and night and it's been so gentle and super hydrating! I've been using it for over two weeks (even on the first day I felt the hydration instantly) and it really soothes a lot of the dry skin pains I would usually have in the morning after washing up. I can tell the difference on the days I'm lazy and don't use the Sioris line! I also break out easily when using new lines of skin care and seemed to especially with Korean cosmetics/skin care (IDK why and I get super sad about it bc I know Korean skincare lines are more advanced than US lines.) I'm just so happy Ive finally found something that works for me!! "
235840375, On Cleanse Me Softly Milk Cleanser ,Evelyn B.,No,35-44, Can't wait for the second purchase! ," Absolutely one of the best cleansers I've ever used! If not because I understand how skin routine works, I wouldn't be using moisturizers; it leaves my skin feeling so silky soft, bouncy, and still feels hydrated. I absolutely love it, so much so, I literally cannot imagine my routine without it anymore. I use it as its own in my am routine and match it up with a jelly-like cleanser for the pm routine. My skin has never been this soft and so healthy. Even my mom, who has super sensitive and dry skin nowadays, loves it. It works miracles! "
235840375, On Cleanse Me Softly Milk Cleanser ,Jona,18-24,Normal, Not my favorite ," I bought this cleanser as I really like milk cleansers as the first step of my skincare routine but this one has not wowed me. The pump gets stuck after one pump but you need more than one pump of product to really cleanse your face. My bottle has stayed mostly full because of this, I wish I would've returned it during the return window. I think there are probably more functional and beneficial milk cleansers out there. "

86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,Victoria,Sensitive,25-35, Will buy again ," I got this b/c I was looking for an aha product to help with my cell turnover. It stung my face first use but only b/c I was using too many actives from other products in combo with this one. I instead use it only 2 or 3 times a week and when I‚Äôm not using many other actives, which got rid of the sting. It did exactly what I needed when used this way and consistently. Definitely will buy again! "
86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,Filufilu,Dry,45-55, Great essence ," I got this as a sample with my recent order. I decided to try it out and it's been great. I immediately noticed a difference with my skin. Because my skin tends to be on the dryer side I did use it with a heavy moisturizer. By doing this for my skin, I noticed an immediate difference. I only used it twice a week and I intend to order it once I'm done with my serums. "
86244113, On Clear Skin 8% AHA Essence ,AK,Sensitive,25-35, Average , I have sensitive skin so this was my first AHA product whatsoever. After using regularly for a month I did not notice a difference on my skin. It is gentle so no side effects but it did not work for my skin. The gel like consistency glides smoothly on my skin which is nice and gentle. Wouldn't order again.

105213987, On Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner ,Allen,Normal,18-24, Hydrating and softening summer toner ," Toner is presented beautifully! There's a very slight and pleasant cherry scent, though that might be a mental trick because of its red color. It's simple, light, watery, hydrating. I also noticed it was skin softening which was a nice surprise. I emptied this during winter and found myself going through it in under two months. I would repurchase for summer instead to get a longer use. Touch expensive, but there is nice packaging and it's an indie brand. Overall recommend for something simple and non-irritating. "

105213987, On Coconut Water Hibiscus + Rosehip Toner ,Anahi R.,Combination,25-35, Pretty Good ," The flower petals alone is what drawn me to this product. It was something different that I wanted to try, especially with hibiscus. It was pretty hydrating and provide good antioxidant properties. For the claim on acne and anti-aging, I don't think I've seen results in that area. But if you want a hydrating toner with some antioxidant boost, then this is it. "

After moving back to the US from Korea, I couldn't get my hands on my favorite Korean moisturizer anymore so was looking for something new around the same price point. I decided to take a chance on Banila Co and I am SO thrilled that I did! A teeny, tiny bit of this moisturizer (I'm talking like, a centimeter on the tip of your finger) goes such a long way, which means good longevity for a small package. The cream is definitely on the heavier side and doesn't absorb as quickly or easily as a lightweight moisturizer, but by morning my skin feels so soft. I haven't used it under makeup and will avoid it during the day because it does tend to feel a bit heavy (and no SPF), but I absolutely reccommend it for night-time intense moisture and hydration! "

This spray is moisturizing but I do not like how it leaves my face looking oily/shiny and very tacky feeling. It doesn't seem to sink into my skin but instead sits on top of it. The spray nozzle is also extremely strong and it nearly knocked me out of my seat when first trying it. I probably will not be repurchasing but it was worth a try.

The only thing is I didn‚Äôt like was the packaging since the push mechanism inside makes it harder to recycle. 
235840425, On Deep In A Barrier Cream ,archer l.,Combination,No, A great tamanu oil moisturizer ," To the best of my knowledge this is one of only two moisturizers that utilize tamanu oil--the other being Krave (in the same price range when taking size into account). It appears all of the negative reviews are from those who did not do their research on this ingredient so be warned tamanu oil is a fairly heavy oil and has a distinct nutty scent (somewhat reminds me of maple syrup and since Sioris doesn't use artificial fragrances you will be smelling this oil) the main point of contention with all of the reviews under 4 stars aside from one which listed a nut allergy. It is an amazing ingredient that does wonders with skin discoloration, fine lines, dry skin, and a generally calming ingredient for the skin. What I like about this formulation in comparison to the Krave barrier cream is that it is lighter and so can be used in some cases during the day and the scent dissipates quicker as well (for me the scent dissipates usually within 10 minutes though I don't really mind it). And this saves me from having to purchase the oil separately and trying to mix with a separate moisturizer. The sole reason to purchase this product is for the formulation with tamanu oil. If that's not an ingredient you are looking for then there are probably better products for you. If the scent of tamanu oil doesn't bother you are you're looking for all the benefits this ingredient offers then I highly recommend this formulation with the other great ingredients offered and a much lighter experience than straight tamanu oil. If the scent is something you are worried about, tamanu oil is sold as an oil in many health supplement stores for around $10 so I'd highly recommend testing it out there before trying this out. "

It‚Äôs fragrance and alcohol free which makes it suitable for sensitive skin, however, if you‚Äôre someone who hates strong, earthy, medicinal or herbal type smells I‚Äôd say move past this one: I don‚Äôt like fragrances and enjoy this types of natural scents, and even I find the smell of this product to be a bit funky.

235840425, On Deep In A Barrier Cream ,Tracey C.,Dry,No, Better for people with normal skin ," I bought this cream as I've had a good experience with the Sioris cleanser. However, like other reviewers have said, the herbal smell is very strong. I'm not usually one to mind an herbal scent, but this was definitely more than I was anticipating. Furthermore, I have eczema and hyper sensitive skin, especially in winter. I didn't have a reaction to it, but found that this cream wasn't hydrating enough for winter. I found myself applying my Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner and Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence sometimes twice to make up for hydration. It's not the worst cream I've tried, but not my favorite. I still think it would be suitable for normal skin types, but it doesn't provide enough moisture for my chronic eczema skin in the winter. "

Although, the parfumed scent may be strong to some on application, it dissipates soon after. Light slime-like consistency but not at all tacky to the touch. As a result, my face feels decently moisturized but not greasy after every use. On the contrary, it feels quite refreshing post-application. A little goes a long way and the packaging too is pretty. I guess my only criticism would be how it's applied coz it doesn't come with a wand/spoon? so it's bare fingers dipped in the tub of product which can make it prone to contamination? if people mind that sort of thing.

When I started my Korean skincare journey, I quickly realized that my skin loves and needs toner (it's slightly oily, very dehyrdated, sensitive). I've tried some good ones over the years. I switched to Olivarrier after an influencer was raving about it. It had a nice, thick, slippery texture and felt very hydrating. Didn't think much more about it. About 3 weeks after I began using it daily, I noticed that my closed comedones were clearing up. At 6 weeks, they're basically gone. I was stunned. I've been fighting them my whole life. I've tried so many chemical and manual exfoliators, and they're either too harsh or don't work. I had all but given up. Bonus: the cystic acne that I get monthly on my jaw has also cleared up! Since it happened so gradually, I wasn't sure which product was responsible. During that time, the only thing I consistently used was the toner. I almost didn't believe it. After I had a reaction to an IPL treatment, I had to stop using all products on my face for a couple weeks. Sure enough, the comedones came back. Started back on the toner, and a month later my skin was clear again. I was going to write a rave review, but Olivarrier changed the formula. I was disappointed but bought the new one.

140973455, On Dual Moist Toning Lotion ,EMS82,Oily,35-44, GOAT ," This toner is the best thing that's ever happened to my skin. When I started my Korean skincare journey, I quickly realized that my skin loves and needs toner (it's slightly oily, very dehyrdated, sensitive). I've tried some good ones over the years. I switched to Olivarrier after an influencer was raving about it. It had a nice, thick, slippery texture and felt very hydrating. Didn't think much more about it. About 3 weeks after I began using it daily, I noticed that my closed comedones were clearing up. At 6 weeks, they're basically gone. I was stunned. I've been fighting them my whole life. I've tried so many chemical and manual exfoliators, and they're either too harsh or don't work. I had all but given up. Bonus: the cystic acne that I get monthly on my jaw has also cleared up! Since it happened so gradually, I wasn't sure which product was responsible. During that time, the only thing I consistently used was the toner. I almost didn't believe it. After I had a reaction to an IPL treatment, I had to stop using all products on my face for a couple weeks. Sure enough, the comedones came back. Started back on the toner, and a month later my skin was clear again. I was going to write a rave review, but Olivarrier changed the formula. I was disappointed but bought the new one. It is slightly less thick then the original, but it still has the same effect on my skin. I just adore this toner! I hope they never discontinue it. "

36315502, On Fermentation Eye Cream ,M P.,Normal,25-35, ," I've used the eye masks from this brand without issue, but this eye cream caused itchiness and since it costs money to ship it back, I'm using it as a (very) expensive hand cream.

"," I have used a retinol eye cream for years and the results are unbeatable when it comes to getting rid of fine lines. After not using skincare for a year, my eyelashes were falling out. I used this eye cream to repair my skin around my eyes and eyelashes, and they grew back with a vengeance. I couldn't have done that with retinol! Love this eye cream for that. "

Thankfully it doesn't do anything bad to my skin besides the stinging. I don't have wrinkle or terrible bags so I can't say how effective it is, but I never noticed a difference in my eye area. I finished the whole tube so as not to be wasteful (though with the stinging I probably shouldn't have) but I wouldn't repurchase this. "
236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Skylar,25-35,25-35, Smells amazing , I don‚Äôt wear makeup but I love using this balm. A tiny bit goes a long way and I just love how it smells. The first time I used it it seemed to pull up a ton of yucky stuff out of my pores. Love this. 
236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Nicole D.,Normal,55+, I need this ," I‚Äôm in love with this cleansing balm. First of all, it‚Äôs pink so I was immediately happy.

236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Alexus,Combination,18-24, Amazing besides the packaging! ," This was a great oil cleanser that smelled nice and worked well! The product itself is great! I just didn't like the packaging. The lid broke early on so I was no longer able to screw it back on. It was just awkward and an inconvenience for it to then on, have no lid. "
236163763, On Fig Cleansing Balm ,Elena,Normal,25-35, Nope , Gave me one of my worst breakouts in years! Something I love about oil cleansing is the way it leaves your skin feeling moisturized.

289133854, On Fixing Tint ,Elizabeth M.,Combination,25-35, Everyday Color ," I bought two colors, Vintage Red and Midnight Mauve, and I use them everyday.

For me, that doesn't bother me at all. I really like the colors and the way it is so light on my lips. Sometimes I will pair it with a light gloss for a little shine. "

289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Jennifer L.,Dry,35-44, Best hairbrush! , It‚Äôs the best hairbrush I‚Äôve ever used! I feel like I‚Äôm getting a scalp massage every time I use it. 
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Allie M.,Combination,25-35, Best Brush I've had in Years ," I have very long, thick hair and my hairbrushes in the past haven't quite been up to the task. I also needed a brush I could use in the shower on occasion. This brush is great. It goes right through my hair without getting stuck.  "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Eva P.,Sensitive,25-35, Better than what you can get at a department stroe for the same price ,"I didn't realize until I got it that it's flexible, which is actually awesome. The curved brush head is very nice for maximum contact when I use it to give myself a little scalp massage. "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Isabella M.,18-24,18-24, Perfect! ," This is going to sound weird probably, but the brush has a curved shape to it and it feels like my head is being caressed by a gentle hand every time I brush my hair, haha. I'd recommend it! "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Emma C.,Normal,25-35, Best brush for fine hair ," I bought this brush because I really like the British M line and I figured I would give it a try. I have fine hair but a lot of it, so needless to say my hair gets tangled easily. This brush is amazing. Super gentle, doesn‚Äôt pull so less hair comes out while brushing. Gets tangled out easily and is super easy to clean. Definitely my favorite brush I have owned. "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,Jean C.,Combination,18-24, Decent brush! ," I saw this brush on SOKO GLAM and thought I'd give it a go as my last brush was on it's last legs. So far no complaints! It does the job and it's quite a nice brush overall. Excellent for cleaning the brush too as it's got holes in the brush and isn't a paddle brush. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't feel it was as strong as my old brush. It takes a few tries to get through tangles compared to before, but I think it's due to this brush being slimmer than my old one. I have very thick hair which doesn't help! But I'm happy with this one, it seems cleaner and sleeker in style and is high quality so I'm sure it'll last a long time. "
289369950, On Flex Gentle Brush ,neil,Dry,25-35, So good I bought a second one ," Bought this as a last minute add to cart for my mom. She ended up loving it so much, that I bought it for my sister. Such a great brush!! "

My problem really is after shower my hair is all tangled up and every time I brush it, hair fall is crazy, but when I use it...lo and behold!!! What?!!! It detangles my hair, no bother and super less hair fall. I don't know the science about it but is surely works!!! "
339565731, On Flower Balm - Pink ,Hannah,Oily,25-35, So cute and effective! ," I love this little lip balm, I keep it in my purse and use it throughout the day to give my lips some color. After about the second use the tint stays on your lips, and I always get compliments on the packaging. If you are looking for something super hydrating you can layer a more occlusive balm on top, I like to use aquaphor to give it some shine. Love it! "
339565731, On Flower Balm - Pink ,Allie M.,Combination,25-35," Nice at first, but then a bit drying "," When I first put this on I loved the texture.

431860324, On Force Shield Superfuel Serum Stick ,oliveoil,Combination,18-24, Gave me a rash ," I liked the product at first, it isn't the most moisturizing or long lasting product as it is a serum stick but overtime, it gave me rashes all over my face and my neck. I usually don't have sensitive skin but this product just irritated my skin so badly that my skin was incredibly dry, red and it stung pretty badly for a couple of days afterwards. "
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Mozett C.,Oily,18-24, Surprisingly Great! ," I was super nervous when I saw that it was green but as others have said, it does well to give some color correcting to redness on my skin.

431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Maddy,Dry,35-44, Great sunscreen for oily or normal skin at a great price ," I like the green tint, and the clean ingredients. It was slightly too mattifying for my dry skin. I prefer something that feels a little more moisturizing. It's frustrating to use my skincare to try to get a good glow, and then to put on sunscreen and all the glow is gone. But for someone with oilier skin, this is probably an excellent choice. "
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Elizabeth C.,Combination,25-35, Non-Greasy , I am pleasantly surprised with how much I like this sunscreen. It is great for winter months were there isn't that much sun during this season. My face is less oily throughout the day and I love the green in it. The sunscreen has not caused any breakouts and I would definitely buy again. I just wished it had a stronger SPF for better protection but for that reason I am only using it for the winter months for now and will reconsider using it this summer. 
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Angie D.,Sensitive,25-35, Good affordable sunscreen ," This sunscreen has a super light and non greasy finish which I love! It's great for warmer and more humid temperatures and I think it would be good for acne-prone skin since it's so light. The green tint does fade and works in nicely to your skin to help reduce redness, but it'll take a little bit of time for it to absorb. The only reason I docked a star was because I love the idea of a pump for dispensing but sometimes the pump is a bit finicky. "
431860273, On Force Shield Superlight Sunscreen SPF 30 ,Waneda O.,Normal,25-35, Great SPF , This one goes on very nice and does not leave any residues behind. I really like the light feel of the SPF knowing it still provides a high level of sun protection.

158422407, On Fresh Herb Origin Cream ,Hans T.,Normal,45-55, Best Moisturizer I've Found ," Let me start this with a couple caveats. First, I'm a guy, so it's difficult to find a moisturizer that's not overpowering in fragrance and doesn't contain mineral oil (the vast majority of moisturizers marketed to men contain oil). Second, I work in Antarctica 8-12 months out of the year, always during the winter months if I'm not doing a full year contract, where it's typically below -20c, windy/gusty, with almost zero humidity (polar desert). I also live in Minnesota and am there during the winter as well, typically on the western plains of the state where the weather is almost identical to Antarctica winters, but slightly higher (not much) humidity. (I basically winter year round between the hemispheres.) Third, I'm a Boiler/Furnace mechanic where I work in varying environments such as the aforementioned environments outside, but also including rooms that are potentially above 30c with high humidity (steam). "
158422407, On Fresh Herb Origin Cream ,Busy C.,Combination,25-35," Rich, actually too rich ","With the above said, this is best moisturizer I've had that can handle all of the above situations. Whether it's -45c, zero humidity, and 45+ knot winds straight at my face or it's 35c, 95% humidity, and I'm covered in ash, soot, grime, dirt, and oil this moisturizer keeps on going. It's heavy enough to keep my skin moisturized in the coldest, driest, windiest conditions, but light enough to not suffocate my skin in hot, humid, dirty conditions. I would almost consider it be recommendable as a year round moisturizer for a lot of people because of the extremely different environments that I use this in. "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,Cinta,Combination,18-24, Solid Product ," This eye cream is very moisturizing and easily applied to the skin. You only need a small amount and there‚Äôs so much that comes in the tube. Just with a couple uses of it, I already see and feel a difference in the moisture of my under eyes. Not sure of other claims but I use it for the moisturizing properties "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,nicxnic,Dry,25-35, Wonderful eye cream ," I was recommended this eye cream from the Soko Glam team and have loved it since. It's light and moisturizing with a really pleasant scent that reminds me of fruity pebbles. For me, I liked it better than the Etude House Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream because it seemed to hydrate a bit better for longer. "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,Erin,Normal,35-44," Nice, but not a favorite "," I bought this after using a Nacific sheet mask and really enjoying the fresh herbal scent and results. This eye cream is nice for PM use (too sticky/too long to absorb for my daytime routine) but at my age I need a thicker, bouncier, firming eye cream for night that targets wrinkles. So this won‚Äôt be a repurchase for me, but for a younger person looking for a solid PM eye cream as a preventative and moisturizing measure, this could be a great choice. "
91716361, On Fresh Herb Origin Eye Cream ,Katie L.,Combination,45-55, Love This Eye Cream , I actually got this product in my monthly Ipsy bag. I love it! I really wanted a product that would brighten my eye area and this has worked a lot better than the former cream I was using. The fact that it is clean and cruelty-free makes it a winner in my book! 
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Evie B.,Sensitive,25-35, Dreamy! ," I got this mask in a skin brightening mask pack, and I LOVED it, It tightened and brightened my skin, and left me with soft, supple clear skin. The scent was subtle and the remaining serum patted in so nicely, I sealed with my moisturiser and went about my day! LOVE! Can't wait for it to come back in stock! "
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Sam,Sensitive,25-35, Incredible! ," Best sheet mask I have tried so far. It almost has a gel like texture and it feels so soothing on my skin.

IT's extremely moisturizing and hydrating. If you don't like very wet sheet masks this might not be the one for you - but for someone with dry or dehydrated skin this is perfection. 
158422378, On Fresh Herb Origin Mask ,Paloma N.,Oily,18-24, good for the winter , this face mask is so great for when skin is dry and irritated from cold weather 
91716358, On Fresh Herb Origin Serum ,Courtney,Combination,25-35, Smells so great , This stuff smells very good. I have figured out The mask version is great. Using the bottled version every night on my face was too much. I started using it on my d√©colletage and neck though and I‚Äôm honestly on my 4th bottle. I love it and it‚Äôs really brightened up the skin. 
91716358, On Fresh Herb Origin Serum ,Jennifer C.,Combination,45-55, Just Wonderful! ," I had an inclination toward this stuff and I was correct. It's a little tacky when it first touches the skin, but it really helps absorb sheet mask serums and moisturizer. "

Considering the price as well, I think it's a steal. I find my skin tone is more even, my texture is lessened, and my acne scars look way less red. I also have found that I can use it with other actives, like salicylic acid serums. "

170123009, On Fundamental Nourishing Eye Butter ,El.,Combination,25-35, Great for sensitive eyes! , This eye cream has a wonderful texture and absorbed really well into my skin. This is one of the first eye creams I ever tried and I found it to be very hydrating and improved the quality of my skin. It never broke me out or irritated the sensitive skin around my eyes. There's a good amount of product in the tube and it lasted a really long time for me. It has great ingredients and I love that it's vegan and cruelty free. I'm loving Klairs and all of their products I've tried. It is slowly becoming my favorite brand. This is definitely worth repurchasing! I would recommend trying this if you struggle with sensitive skin or are just starting out on your skin care journey!

It's like an undo button for bad habits and time itself. My tired eyes and chapped lips, creeping wrinkles are erased like literal magic. It leaves my skin with this buttery, silk finish that is stunning. Important night? Definitely doing one of these first. I use facial wash (cosmic dew) then toner (first essence rx) then a little serum (watermelon dew all over) *then* one of these masks. I try to not ""wash"" it off but just put a little water on my hands, wipe off the excess, then pat/air dry. Then I finish my routine with glow serum and lotion (super ceramide renewal cream).

I‚Äôve had them for over a month and I‚Äôve tried using them twice instead of double-cleansing and my skin was not happy. My skin needs actual water to start the hydration process, which these do not supply.

I used this right after my cleanser and followed with a moisturizer. Removed this from my routine and the bumps disappeared. Added it back in and the bumps were also back. It's likely that the arbutin didn't work well with my skin sadly "

I didn‚Äôt feel stinging, most likely as it has a very minimal amount. However this cream in itself is definitely not hydrating enough and would require another layer to keep your skin moisturized.

40533577, On Glycolic Acid Cream ,Drew,Dry,25-35, Decent ,But with consistent usage I do see improvements of the skin surface as it appears smoother - but the change is very slight.

All the centella really works, and at under $3/mask they're affordable enough to slap on as-needed, instead of hoarding for a self-care pamper day. There's also plenty of extra essence. "
80494774, On Goodbye Redness Centella Mask Pack ,Kevanna D.,Combination,25-35, Bye bye redness! ," I loved this mask!!! It was so soothing on my irritated skin and did just the trick to rid of my redness. There so so much serum on their mask, it was oozing as I pressed it into my face.

80494774, On Goodbye Redness Centella Mask Pack ,Ingrid,Sensitive,25-35, So Hydrating! ," I ordered two of these single packs, one for me and one for my boyfriend to try. It really did calm our red inflamed dry skin, and it was incredibly hydrating. He wasn't crazy about the concept of sheet masks as a whole since they're pretty cold and slimy feeling to wear, which I agree with lol, but he liked the results and may possibly do this with me again lol. A good product with lots of essence. My only complaint was that while it fit my face fairly well, it was fairly small on his; I had to tear the eye holes to keep it from being literally in his eyes. We'll likely order this again, at least for myself if not for him. "

The oil cleanser is a nice consistency, lasted me over 7 months while using two pumps one or two times a day and is the perfect first step in my skin care regime. I bought another oil cleanser and though it gets the job done, it doesn't have as pleasant as a smell as this rice cleanser. "
247391381, On Grain Water Cleansing Oil ,Sweetlulu,Combination,35-44, Didn't like , I was introduce to this by a consultant to try to use on days I use makeup or have a lot of buildup but I found that it didn't work for me. After using it for a month I found it made my skin slightly oily after use and it didn't remove my makeup as well as I hoped it did. It did keep my skin moisturized and not dry. I think this product would do well with someone who has dry skin. 
225529975, On Green Golden Ruler ,Anna,Dry,No, Great summer moisturizer ," I love the light smell of this moisturizer, it‚Äôs super refreshing.

225529975, On Green Golden Ruler ,MJ,Sensitive,No, Better than expected. Perfect winter moisturizer , This was my first product from Chasin Rabbits and I had no expectations when trying this product.

208710421, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Moisture Cream ,Louise,Sensitive,35-44, Gentle Moisturizer ," My skin is really sensitive and I was looking for a nighttime moisturizer. This is more like a gel than a cream, and it has a pleasant, light smell. It absorbs pretty quickly and didn‚Äôt sting, give me any redness or irritation, or break me out.

I don't usually have sensitive skin but this product gave me a terrible reaction. This product was recommended to me from the concierge skin consultation and within seconds of applying to my face, I felt it become very itchy and super hot. Using it within the week had led my face to to a very bad breakout that took a few weeks for it to fully recover. This had been my first time going along with a proper skincare routine and led me to quit using any kind of skincare within the future. Thankfully, keeping my skincare routine to just rinsing with water allowed it to heal from this horrible first experience. "

222882228, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pad ,Monii H.,Combination,18-24, First Toner Pad , I bought this because I‚Äôve always wanted to try toner pads after seeing Korean skincare YouTubers use them and luckily this was one sale during Lunar New Year so I bought it. I love it! I have some redness on my cheeks so I left the toner pads as like a mask on my cheeks and after absorbing I could tell that my redness faded a bit so I love the formula too. It‚Äôs also very lightweight for morning use since I love light formulas in the morning so I highly recommend this product! 
222882228, On Houttuynia Cordata Calming Toner Pad ,Rachael S.,Oily,35-44, I love these toner pads! ," These feel so soothing and also cleansing but if you want also offer super mild exfoliation if you use the barely textured grid side. There is also a ton of liquid toner left in the container so they won't dry out, and plastic tweezers that actually fit inside the tub (huge pet peeve of mine when tweezers and scoops don't fit in the product container) to keep the product clean. I also have the essence, which I love, and have used the sheet masks (also loved and plan to repurchase) and I think I may need the moisturizer too. These toner pads feel like they can do so many for someone with sensitive skin on a budget if you ask me as they can exfoliate, tone, feel similar to the essence, and since I ran out of their sheet masks I bet I can stick a few of these in the fridge and lay them on my face until I buy more. Also 70 pads for the price is a great buy! "

I avoid heat on my hair but have noticed that using this makes my hair smooth, shiny, and manageable. I will take that any day of the week for $8. I also like the light scent as I do not like my hair products to compete with my perfume - it smells like a classic lotion. Just bought 2 more. "
278682458, On Hydro LPP Treatment ,Candice,Combination,25-35, Will Repurchase , Let me start by stating that I have fine/thinning hair (stress) and its incredibly hard for me to find a silicone free conditioner that doesn't weigh my hair down and cost an arm and a leg. I know that this product was meant for people with damaged hair but I got it in hopes that it would restore the shine. I was skeptical when I read the directions stating it should be applied from scalp to ends instead of the usual midlenghts to ends but I followed the directions and I'm glad I did. Even if it didn't restore the shine I'd still buy it again based on it's price point and the fact that it conditions without weighing down my hair. Will definitely repurchase.

I was hoping to achieve the same results with this mask, but it was not meant to be. I used one of these masks today and it left my skin with tiny bumps and acne breakouts. The mask also didn't smell very good. "

I've used it on my lips when i've been exposed to the cold winds. I have put it on my hair and my kids elbows for rough skin. It really is a solid rescue-er.

She says that it is very refreshing, no stickiness, and doesn't ruin any makeup if you use it as a refreshing mist during the day. She loves it more than her old formula! It gets used daily and she feels that her skin is always glowing with this! "

222559684, On LHA Blemish Ampoule ,Megan M.,Combination,18-24, Great Purchase , I have used this product for about six months and love it. It helps heal any acne blemishes in a way that is less harsh and is less prone to dry out my face. My skin just feels healthier since using this in my skincare routine. 
222559684, On LHA Blemish Ampoule ,Eva P.,Normal,35-44, AMAZING!!! ," I love this. I was skeptical especially since it is only $15 but oh my god, this works. It helps so much with clearing acne (I mainly get whiteheads and cystic) and I will definitely buy again when I run out of my current one. The only downside is the bottle is a bit small. "

The toner is refreshing, the serum is light and soft. For reference, I have combination-type skin and my skin has a hard time absorbing products. This product was easy for my skin to absorb and did not make it feel goopy as sometimes happens with other serums and oils. I paired this serum with the acwell toner, eye-cream and the hanskin calming essence, and I think that combination is so wonderful. I definitely want to purchase the full products! "

73985179, On Licorice pH Balancing Essence Mist ,Molly,Dry,35-44," Great product, spay needs improvement "," This mist is instantly smoothing to my skin, but the spray bottle is just‚Ä¶off. The spray is a super fine mist (good, in my opinion) but doesn‚Äôt spray widely enough, so it lands in a specific spot on my face rather than coating the whole face. Not sure if that makes sense, but I end up just putting several sprays/pumps in my hand and then applying that evenly to my face. Still a great product but I don‚Äôt end up reaching for it daily. "

289369861, On Licorice pH Balancing Essential Cream ,Emma,Oily,Oily, If you have face eczema read this , I ordered this because my skin has been drying out a lot more than normal. Based on product description it seemed like a good fit for my dry but also acne prone and oily skin. I'm rating 3 stars not because I have any complaints about the product itself but because I cannot use it on my whole face. I have newly developed eczema spots near my eyes and this product's packaging states not to use it on eczema at all--a detail that is missing from this web page! I would not have ordered if I knew i could not use it over my eczema as now I have to buy something else until the eczema clears.

I would recommend this to anyone and will definitely repurchase! "
18257436, On M BB Boomer Primer ,Ashley,Combination,25-35," Noce primer, not fond of the scent "," I pair this with Missha BB cream and I really like how the two pair with my skin. After a 12 hour work day my face is not to shiny and no creases. I would recommend as a primer. The reason I give this 4 stars is because of the scent. it smells like an older ladies perfume. And with wearing a mask (due to Covid) it seems to linger. I was hoping it would fade after putting on but the scent remains (subtle enough others will not smell it, but on your own face and with a mask on, it does seem to linger some. This formula would be excellent non-scented. Note: the primer and the BB cream appear to both have the same scent "

It has a light floral sweet scent, but my skin hasn‚Äôt reacted to it which is such a bonus. I wish they still had the travel kit for MadeCera though.

We cannot live without it and she makes me buy 4-5 during the Soko Glam Sale. Therefore, I've given all the other Madecera items a try and I have been disappointed. This moisturizer foams up a lot and the texture is nice, but it completely strips your skin of oils. Afterwards my skin felt so uncomfortable, like I had washed my face with cheap bar soap! I've never used such an offensive cleanser in my life, even for drugstore products! This is the worst product I have ever purchased on Soko Glam ever. I am a VIP Premier member who has never returned anything at Soko Glam. I looked at the Return Policy and you have to pay $10 return shipping..... for a $15 product?

I initially got a trial size, then ordered a full size and then left my full size at a hotel while I was traveling. I use a tiny, tiny amount and I love it so much. The texture is creamy and as long as I use a tiny bit, it isn't drying at all. I also think it is a really good value considering you don't need a lot. I have very dry cheeks and oily t-zone so I start at my t-zone with my washing and then I use less on the dry area. "

If I use a mask, before or after?) but I really like the addition of a pad-based product in my routine. I think since I started skincare as a young teenager with Noxzema pads, I really dig the feeling of sweeping this over my skin. It‚Äôs fragrance is a very light, clean scent.

They work as a light cleanser if you don't need to rid yourself of any layers of makeup or sunscreen, and/or a toner pad if you use the lightly textured side. They are so full of moisture though that even with the salicylic acid they can be used as an essence pad or left on for a few minutes as a mask. They are good for travel too as there isn't really extra liquid to spill out in a bag or anything and the jar is a flip-top lid (it screws off too but this way you don't lose it or drop it on a dirty floor).

It hasn't made me breakout, but I'm not sure it's really doing anything either. I thought it would be more moisturizing than it is for me. My skin is sensitive and tends to be dry in places during the winter. I've been having an issue with products creating redness and this doesn't do that. I'm just not sure if it really is a product I needed in my skincare routine. I agree with another reviewer that sometimes it feels like it wants to pill when applying. A little does go a long way. So if this product works well for you it is worth it. "

I might save it to use during the summer months because it is a little drying for me right now, but it hasn't wowed me yet either. It hasn't made my face red, which is an issue I have with other water cleansers. A little does go a long way, you barely need any to wash your face and neck.

It's a little bit of a hassle to untangle the mask from the protective layers its encased in (not to mention wasteful). I'm confused why the mask is encased in so many layers because I didn't find it particularly hydrating at all. The mask didn't fit well, and actually stung my face and I'm usually not irritated by anything. There's so many other great sheet masks on this website, I'd recommend you purchase another instead. "

I added this to my routine about two weeks ago and I've been very happy. It has an immediate cooling and soothing sensation and sinks into my skin quickly without feeling dry. I use it in the morning, after rinsing my face. I follow up with a moisturizer and sunscreen. I don't wear foundation or a full face of makeup, but I sometimes used a Fenty pressed powder on my nose and chin, and it sits well on my skin after using this. I haven't had any breakouts or sensitivity from this, and I will keep using it because I like the cooling feeling and I think my moisturizer sinks in well after using this. "
237466173, On Moon Glow Milky Toning Lotion ,Anna,Sensitive,18-24, Good but not my holy grail , Used the whole bottle and thought that it was nice but not worth a repurchase.

I don't use it nearly as often as recommended, though, because of two reasons. One is the large pieces of crushed plants in the mask are very sensory unfriendly (I'm autistic), but it's bearable if you're careful when rinsing to not get it in your eyes or nose. The other is that it smells awful, I joke when I use it that it's my ""pond mud"" mask because that's exactly what it smells like to me, a pond or swamp.

I enjoy the herbal smell, but it is strong and may not be for everyone. The mask also has flecks of organic matter which are a bit difficult to rinse off with just water-a gentle wipe with a washcloth will help! "

289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,Ashley,Sensitive,25-35, Love it for super chapped lips ," I found this to feel more like a typical lip gloss than a lip balm. I've never liked lipglosses because of the sticky texture and this is too sticky. There is also a slight artificial fragrance. If you like glosses, you'll probably like this. The color is nice. "
289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,Zakiah,Dry,25-35, Holy grail lip balm , I have perpetually had dry lips my entire life no matter which climate I lived in. Being on certain meds as an adult has made the situation worse. Wanted to try this as an alternative to carmex as I'm sick of eating wads of petroleum to keep my lips from bleeding and most lipsticks gunk up on my dry lips. 
289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,Camille,Combination,25-35, Eh‚Ä¶too sticky ,This is a fantastic alternative to something like carmex. It still provides the needed hydration but without the bad ingredients. Plus the color is fantastic. I ordered the lychee which is a muted red tint on and just ordered the petal to have a neutral for daily use when I'm not wearing makeup.  
289134249, On Naturium Phyto-Glow Lip Balm ,krys,Oily,18-24, So pretty ," This is an incredibly pretty balm. Doesn't leave my lips feeling dry and the hue is perfect. I usually apply is over a lip tint and the result is lovely without being too much. If I put on too much, it does get a bit sticky but that's user error and not on the product. "

It has a soft, smooth texture that isn‚Äôt sticky or clumpy and feels amazing on the lips. It has little to no smell which I prefer with a lip product since it is so near my nose. It also has such a pretty tint that is buildable - I use this as my primary lip balm and also on top of a lip liner or lipstick as a hydrating glossy lip colour it‚Äôs the perfect shade for me. And it is so hydrating for the lips on top of all that. I also love the packaging over a traditional stick balm, pot, or doe foot applicator as it stays clean and is easy to use on the go and won‚Äôt mix with a lipstick if you use it on top of makeup. It‚Äôs the perfect lip balm! "

I didn‚Äôt realize how similar it was going to be to my previous cleanser, MAKE beauty succulent skin wash, but they are practically the same in terms of texture. I do feel like the MAKE beauty cleanser cleanses my skin a bit more thoroughly, but this is perfect for the winter weather. It makes my skin so soft and smooth and it‚Äôs awesome that you can use it on dry or wet skin as well as a mask.

I have extremely oily skin, and gel creams are the only moisturizers I use because regular face lotions are too heavy for my skin type.

This gel cream moisturizes my face, and this is the only gel cream I‚Äôve tried that doesn‚Äôt make me look greasy and oily afterwards. And it‚Äôs fragrance free, so that‚Äôs a plus! I don‚Äôt know if I would recommend this to people with dry or even normal skin, but I would definitely recommend to people with oily skin like mine. This is my new go to for gel creams! "

Unfortunately I don't think this is best suited for dry skin, I've used this consistently for two weeks and no matter how much product I use my skin seems to feel extremely dehydrated.

477437671, On Night Off Face Wash ,Mac,Combination,25-35," incredibly gentle, crazy effective, one-step makeup remover and cleanser "," i gotta say i was skeptical when this didn't feel like your typical cleanser or makeup remover jelly (I had bought Plenaire's before this, and it's fine but this is infinity times better). My tip for using Night Off is water makes all the difference - the consistency goes from being pretty thick and not very jelly-ish to slippery with minor suds. it takes ALL the makeup off with zero to minimal rubbing (and you really only need to rub if like me you like to wear triple coat mascara & tightlined eyeliner). I couldn‚Äôt believe it - the only time i‚Äôve had makeup come off this easily was with Clean it Zero but Night Off is less oily and actually cleanses (ie not just taking makeup off). I really love this stuff, i‚Äôm saving so much money and time relative to my old cleansing routine. i‚Äôve been using for ~2wks now and can safely say i‚Äôm never going back. "

I find its texture smooth and it absorbs right into my skin. Moreover, it's soothing on the skin. I use one pump and I have enough to include my neck. I don't find it to be sticky or to have an overpowering scent as I've read a few times in these reviews. Straight rosehip oil has a much more viscous consistency and has a natural scent which is also found in this product. The scent dissipates shortly after application in a normal and agreeable way.

466827195, On PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum ,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35, Very good ," Been using this serum for a few weeks and I‚Äôll be honest- it‚Äôs definitely not an overnight game changer, but I do really like it. I definitely had to give it time to see how it works and personally I need more than the 4-5 drops. I use the whole dropper‚Äôs worth but I do think it had made a difference in the overall texture and look of my face. I think with the caffeine I do see less puffiness in my face as well. It goes on lightly and is not greasy which is nice and it doesn‚Äôt pill under any products I‚Äôve used. Not sure I‚Äôll buy again but I‚Äôm definitely going to finish the bottle! "
466827195, On PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum ,Jaime T.,Sensitive,35-44, Probably too soon to tell , This is a very nice serum. It has a great texture. I can tell that it has strong active ingredients because my skin is reacting to it similarly to when I started Tretinoin. However I haven‚Äôt really seen results yet. It‚Äôs only been a couple of weeks so I‚Äôm going to use the entire bottle before I make a final judgement. So far so good though.

455971, On Perfect Cover BB Cream SPF 42 PA+++ ,Danielle,Dry,35-44, LOVE this BB cream ," I can't stand using foundation because I can never find anything that doesn't feel too thick on my face; normally, it just sits there and feels like it exists to smudge everywhere. I like using just basic concealers or tinted sunscreen, but I tried this and I don't know if I'll ever go back. It moisturizes, it's not greasy or sticky or thick, and it still provides the coverage I need for my skin, which tends toward dry, red, sensitive, and sometimes flaky on my T-zone. I don't notice any flakes when I apply this, and it goes on very evenly. "

This seems to actually calm my redness immediately after use! I didn‚Äôt even know this was possible! EVERYTIME I used other cleansers my face would always be hot and red. I always thought that was normal until looking into k beauty cleansing. I used the skin concierge service and this was one of the recommendations. I couldn‚Äôt be happier with how well it works. I highly recommend for dry, sensitive skin with redness. "

My skin got so dry after starting epuido forte so I needed something that was both extremely hydrating and gentle. I use this only as a morning cleanser and like others, I was not a fan of the no-foam situation at first, but my skin feels really nice and hydrated afterward.

My makeup stays on better and for longer, too. I am thrilled and plan on repurchasing it when I need to - you only need a little to use for your whole face, so it'll take me a while to get through this bottle. "

330333545, On Plant-Rich Antioxidant Pore Cleansing Oil ,Carrie,Dry,35-44, Miracle in a bottle. ," I was in the market for a new face wash and decided to take a chance on this one, and I'm glad I did. Not only is the price point decent, but you also get a good amount in the bottle for what you pay. The pore-cleansing oil feels very silky when you're using it. I tried it two different ways. The first was by taking my makeup off and then washing my face with the cleansing oil. The result was incredible, your face feels silky and smooth, the makeup is cleared from your pores, and you can see how clean your face is, as well as feel it. The second way I cleaned my face was to not remove my makeup first. This way really put the product to the test, but it really works. The pore-cleansing oil makes it look like it melts the makeup off of your face as you're washing it. The results are almost identical. You do get a better cleanse by removing your makeup first. For example, stubborn mascara, things like that. But if you're just too lazy or not feeling well, you can still wash your face with just the cleansing oil, and it will still take it off. You might just have to use an extra pump of the face wash. Personally, I think that's pretty impressive when other face washes I've tried can't even do that. "

I've had natural dread locs over 20 years and I love discovering new products to use. This serum is mediocre. It's always a risk buying something with a fragrance and this purchase was no exception. It was a very strong artificial fragrance and I tend more to essential oil and natural fragrances. This would be better for someone with a different hair type. I'm of mixed ancestry and my dominant ethnicity is Black and I have that textured hair. It didn't add much shine either that I could see but locs are different than straight hair or curls.

This product at least for me caused fairly severe irritation the moment it was applied, and I've used cleansing balms & oils for 5+ years, so I was definitely surprised as it's a fairly well known cult favourite product that I was excited to try. Even the morning after my skin is red and inflammed.....upon taking a closer look at the ingredients I think the cause was the orange oil (a common trigger ingredient for sensitive skin types) "

I got this cleansing oil to temporarily replace the cleansing balm, however, I actually like this better than the balm. I believe that the citrus oils in this oil cleanser are making my face look brighter, smoother, and clearer. The texture is not as 'slippery' as the cleansing balm (which is obviously thicker), but it is nonetheless effective in getting my face clean without stripping it. I also love the smell. All I need is one full pump to get a good cleanse, which makes this very cost effective. I follow up with the Cica Cleanser; truly a perfect pair for my oily/sensitive/acne prone skin. "

I'm pleased to say that I have had no troubles! I should note that my allergy is moderate (hives and eczema rather than anaphylactic shock, even to expeller-pressed soybean oil).

208521012, On Real Aqua Balancing Ampoule ,Hannah,Combination,25-35, Amazing for dehydrated skin ," I had dehydrated skin for a long time without realizing it - I always thought it was just dry because dry and dehydrated skin present the same (dry). Dry skin is treated with oil/ceramides, while dehydrated skin needs water. No amount of oil improved my skin's hydration, however this little serum completely changed my skin! My skin is back to a normal water content and is dewy and lovely, and my barrier is restored. This serum is excellent for dehydrated skin - I've tried other water based serums but this is my favorite, I'm on my 5th bottle with no plans of stopping. I highly recommended IF your skin is dehydrated. I've seen a few reviews saying it didn't work for them - could be that they need oil not water. If you feel like your skin is dry but nothing helps, give this serum a try! "
208521012, On Real Aqua Balancing Ampoule ,Nicole H.,Sensitive,25-35," Not great, not bad "," I've struggled to find a good serum or ampoule that hydrates my skin without clogging my pores. This doesn't clog my pores resulting in a break out or cystic acne the next morning, but it also is only mildly hydrating. It's thin and watery, and barely feels like I'm adding any additional moisture. Maybe 10%. I'll finish the bottle, but definitely wouldn't repurchase. "

208521215, On Real Aqua Balancing Cream ,Anna,Combination,18-24, Great on sensitive skin , I have been using this moisturizer for over a year and bought multiple times. I needed something that was less of a water cream and slightly thicker. It‚Äôs super light weight and had cleared my skin after a couple weeks of using it. It‚Äôs not fragrant so I see it as a hypoallergenic moisturizer. My skin is sensitive and has broken out with the little of changes. I had attempted a different moisturizer before just for fun and my skin had reacted negatively. Once I returned to this moisturizer I cleared up. This isn‚Äôt a fancy moisturizer but the simplicity of it is great and it works.

This oil cleanser is gentle and does a great job dissolving any makeup and/or sunscreen before I use my SOLVED Coconut Foaming Cleanser. The green tea leaves at the bottom is a nice touch. Also, the bottle is a nice size so it takes a while to finish. "

It has gentle exfoliation, so it's like a 3 in one! I have normal skin that can get dehydrated but this cleanser leaves my skin clean and soft, not tight or dry. I love it. I will continue buying this. I think it is a wonderful product. My teen daughter loves it too. "

While this isn‚Äôt a problem for me, sometimes I just don‚Äôt have time to mix it in all the way so I don‚Äôt use it on those nights. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone who doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time to spend on a skincare routine, probably it would be easier to use a liquid vitamin c product. However if you have the time, I think it is definitely worth it. "

80494440, On Real Vita C Powder Lemon ,terry,Sensitive,35-44, liquid was more effective ," I didn't see a huge difference on my skin with this. I thought this would work based on all the good reviews, but after I tried a liquid vitamin c serum, I found the liquid vitamin c more effective. Maybe because the powder doesn't really melt even after combining it with a toner, so your skin doesn't absorb it as much. I have sensitive combo skin, acne prone, and my scars heal pretty slow. Maybe the results are quicker for other skin types. "

So it was probably a singular product defect. I use this stuff religiously on my hormonal and cystic acne in the am instead of makeup (sometimes i follow w colour pop powder) and it never breaks me out, looks natural, and goes on smooth! I‚Äôll never wear makeup agin after discovering this product. "

I haven't worn foundation or concealer since the start of the pandemic... which has done wonders for my skin. BUT! I also have really sensitive skin, so I have quite a bit of redness. I saw this and was hoping it was a much more affordable version of Dr Jarts green tiger balm. Guys this stuff is tinted, and supposedly adjusts to your skin tone. LOL. I'm the color of mayonnaise and like it that way so this stuff literally turned into a brown patch on me. Sooooo disappointing. :( Gonna give it away to a tan friend. "

It smells so good (I know many are averse to fragrance for allergen reasons, but I have very sensitive skin and this seems so be so gentle and not bothersome so far) and is incredibly soothing to apply. It also absorbs well- I put it on after cleansing and toning, and then follow with neogen sunscreen and a ccc cream from CLE. Altogether it gives my skin a dewy and supple look, and helps fight the dry air of New England winter. I recommend for anyone with dry skin who doesn't have to worry about fragrance! "

466817919, On Retinol Expert 0.1% ,Claire,Sensitive,25-35, It's so great to have pure 0.1% retinol ,"Now, I used this product on my neck nightly since first getting this product. Now, I normally wouldn‚Äôt use a retinal right away nightly, and I would space out and ladder up my applications in time, but since I carry most of my skin care down to my neck, I felt comfortable with the frequent application. I find the product itself to be thicker than expected, but easily spreadable. It had a yellow hue and an interesting scent to it, but it is not unpleasant. I like to use this before I put my normal moisturizer over my neck. I‚Äôm the two month since using this product, I have noticed a reduction in hyperpigmentation from past acne and the fading of past acne scars. I find this product mixes well with most of my other skin care products, other than certain actives, like BHA. (I would not normally recommend or use Retinal or BHA together in a routine, but for the sake of the review I did for a few times) I would recommend this product for someone looking for a low irritating retinal that pairs well with other products. I will say though, for the price, as much as I like it, I probably won‚Äôt repurchase in the future in addition to the Rx Retinoid I currently use. If you have the change, and want to try this product, I would recommend this product for you, as I‚Äôve seen results in a short period of time. "

25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Jen G.,Sensitive,35-44, Not hydrating enough ," I‚Äôm not sure why this is called *rich and *moist because for my very sensitive dry/combination acne eczema prone skin, I definitely notice an overly tight feeling after using this as the second step of my double cleanse routine. I feel like it is more for normal to oily and great for acne care because it has a distinct tea tree smell to it. "
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Remy,Oily,35-44, Lovely foaming delicious smelling cleanser ," I really like this cleanser and highly recommend it. The bottle automatically foams the cleanser as you pump it out and one pump on a silicone facial cleansing pad is more than enough even after a long sweaty and oily skin day. The smell is light and pleasing and the foaming very lovely and rich with a wonderfully nice lather. This was the first time I used a foaming facial cleanser and this cleanser has converted me. I can't imagine going back to a regular non-foaming cleaner. Although the bottle is small it lasts forever, one bottle lasted me 4 months, and I ended up appreciating the size of the bottle, it is small so you can take it traveling as well, very convenient! It leaves skin feeling clean without drying and I noticed an improvement in my skin with fewer pimples after 2 weeks of using this cleanser. "
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Emily,Sensitive,25-35, Refreshing! , Absolutely love this wash! The scent is incredible- smells like eucalyptus without burning your skin at all. Very refreshing! I don‚Äôt use the whole pump and my skin feels fresh every time. 
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,neil,Oily,25-35, Top tier , So I have been using this cleanser for a couple of months now.

25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Cristina,Sensitive,18-24, holy grail foaming cleanser , I have been using this cleanser for years.

25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,Patricia V.,Sensitive,35-44, My New Fave! ," I love this cleanser! I have been using this for about two weeks now.

25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,neil,Oily,25-35, Meh ," Gave this a try because I'm a fan of the other rich moust products, but my skin wasn't vibing with it (which is ok!) Gave to my mom, and she enjoys it! She has dryer skin than I do, so maybe that's why. "
25838697, On Rich Moist Foaming Cleanser ,M D.,Normal,18-24, Decent cleanser! ," This is a good cleanser! The tea tree smell is definitely way too strong and the concentration should be lowered, but the foam is luxurious and adequately cleans my skin "

I really wanted to love this product because the texture is so wonderful, but something in it is seriously clogging my pores. After discontinuing use for four days (and with the help of the rest of my routine) my skin texture is returning to normal. "
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,Rosana,Combination,18-24, Repurchasing! , After trying a couple more I have decided to repurchase it. At first I didn't love it because I felt it was not moisturizing enough but after pairing it with a good watery toner and letting it dry just a little bit between layers helped balance out my dehidratef skin and it was quick to absorb and that is something important for me because I live in a humid climate. 
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,Hannah,Sensitive,18-24, Great!!! ," Great for anyone looking for a serum for sensitive skin. It smells different than other serums, but I believe that's due to no fragrances being included - which is perfect for someone like me that has skin reactions to all scents. It leaves my face feeling so nice and smooth after using! "
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,Milly V.,Dry,18-24, Hydration Nation ," I really like this serum because it's nice and light. I've bought this along with my Klairs supple toner, and that combo does justice, but I also feel like it does the same thing as the toner. I've opted this out of my routine because I don't really see it as necessary in my daily day and night routine, but it add an extra layer of hydration if you're into that! "
20067262, On Rich Moist Soothing Serum ,Sam,Sensitive,25-35, I'm giving it 5 stars because I want to explain the sme ," Yes it has a more chemically smell. That is because it has no other fragrances to cover that up. People like me who are allergic to fragrance find it hard get products that don't have fragrance. Did you know that some fragrances are actually used to create no scent at all? This product doesn't even use that. It doesn't mean it has bad ""chemicals"" in there. Many things with fragrances would smell this way if you took the fragrance out. For me and people like me, I'd take something that doesn't smell like flowers but doesnt irritate my skin. These people who are scared of the ""chemical"" smell don't really understand what's going on here. You don't notice it as soon as your done putting it on. Don't worry about it. It's a great serum and I'm so thankful something like this exists. "

17655817, On Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence ,Lisa G.,Dry,25-35, Bee Goodness Trifecta ," This essence came highly recommended, but I don‚Äôt know that it entirely lived up to the hype, given the price. I did legitimately enjoy using it. I do think a fair bit of my enjoyment was just due to how bougie the bottle is. If you‚Äôre specifically hoping for an essence, maybe look into a different option, as both the packaging (dropper bottle) and texture (not watery) is not conducive to using it as an essence. But in terms of a good moisturizing, soothing serum, this is a fantastic choice because it has the bee trifecta of royal jelly, honey and propolis. I would definitely consider repurchasing next winter. "
17655817, On Royal Honey Propolis Enrich Essence ,Carlee C.,Dry,25-35, Love this! , It‚Äôs moisturizing and it makes your skin feel soft. I recently bought a lot of skin care so I‚Äôm just trying to figure out what step to make it.

This exfoliates extremely well without irritation (although, I only use it every few days, if you used it more often, perhaps it would become irritating. I also should note that I do not have overly sensitive skin). I normally use an oil cleanser with PHA or BHA to clean and exfoliate and this works even better and makes my skin feel completely smooth. This is a great step before applying makeup to make your makeup set evenly. Since I only use it every few days, I expect this tube should last a long time, too! "
85450057, On Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel ,Ari Z.,Combination,18-24, Nice and gentle ," A very gentle exfoliator -- I'm not sure as much dead skin as I would like is coming off, but it does definitely smooth the skin and create a clean feeling. "
85450057, On Rub-A-Dub Refining Peel Gel ,Suzanne,Combination,25-35, Great for a skin refresh ," I use this about once per week in the shower, and I find that it provides nice exfoliation without being drying or irritating. The product has jojoba beads but also is formulated so that it clumps up while you scrub, which makes for a gentle physical exfoliation. It's helped reduce my breakouts, and has ESPECIALLY helped with maskne. Docking a star because the ""use after cleansing and drying"" process is a little cumbersome, but I definitely like it enough to keep buying it. "

Not the most hydrating serum, so I have to use a thicker moisturizer on top, but it's really great for irritated skin.

422221331, On Sebum Balancing Gel Moisturizer ,Elizabeth M.,Combination,25-35, Good Alternative to TIMY Gel Moisturizer , I decided to give this a try as a summer moisturizer and it does a good job of keeping me hydrated! I‚Äôll probably have to switch to something more intense for winter but I love this for the warmer months. 
422221331, On Sebum Balancing Gel Moisturizer ,Jessica,Oily,25-35, Disappointed ," I have naturally oily skin and live in a humid climate year around, so I have been looking for better less oily moisturizer. Sadly, this did not feel oily but after three days of using this only in morning my face has broken out , turned completely dry, and my neck has developed a horrible dry itchy rash. Steer clear of this one. "

307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Autumn R.,Dry,25-35, Super Moisturizing ," This moisturizer is thick without being heavy. Many moisturizers are too thin for me, leaving my face feeling tight by midday. Not this stuff. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump. Plus I love that it comes in a tube! Way more hygienic than a jar. "
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Melissa,Combination,25-35, Repairing , The only product I have tried recently that is helping repair my damaged skin barrier 
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Melissa M.,Combination,25-35, Repairing my skin ," I destroyed my skin barrier in December with retinol and tried multiple products without much luck. Enter this product! My skin barrier is finally starting to recover. It has not broken me out, and it is thick without being greasy. I prefer to use it at night, but it is okay for day use as well. "
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Linda L.,Dry,35-44, Ceramide savior , This cream relieved dryness and irritation. It is really thick and perfect for my evening routine. I'm not too keen on the scent but very keen on the results! 
307862918, On Seven Layer Ceramide Cream ,Harshali,Dry,25-35, Hanskin makes the best products hands down! ," This cream is exactly what it says it is and delivers on that moistness. It is PACKED with ceramides, and both type of ceramides that our skin barrier needs - hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic ones. So it gets absorbed into the deeper layers of the skin as well. The cream has a slightly thick and rich texture but it goes on the skin easily and does not feel greasy.  "
307862592, On Seven Layer Ceramide Serum ,Carol R.,Combination,35-44, Surprising creamy texture! ," This is hydrating and lightweight enough for humid climates! One pump is enough. At night, I use two pumps and not use moisturizer and it seems to work for me. I would repurchase :) "
307862592, On Seven Layer Ceramide Serum ,Lisa G.,Dry,25-35, More Ceramides Than You Even Thought You Wanted ," If you want the ceramide serum equivalent of Pokemon‚Äôs Gotta Catch ‚ÄòEm All, look no further than the Hanskin Seven Layer Ceramide Serum. This emulsion texture has seven ceramides (ergo the name), plus a ceramide precursor, panthenol, cholesterol, beta glucan, urea and panthenol, basically making it a one-stop shop for skin barrier support. The texture can feel a bit tacky at first, but it dries down easily. And the price! Ceramides are expensive to formulate with, but the price per mL is great on this. I‚Äôve got a lot of ceramide serums I love and while this one might not be the most elegant, I‚Äôll probably rebuy it. "
307862592, On Seven Layer Ceramide Serum ,Debb,Combination,35-44, Ceramide Heaven in a Bottle! ," FINALLY! I‚Äôve been looking for something that can sub in for Dr. Jart‚Äôs Ceramidin Liquid‚Äîand I finally found it!! Thanks for curating this because it‚Äôs hard enough to find ceramide serums. And this is equally as velvety smooth and fast absorbing as the Dr. Jart‚Äôs serum. We‚Äôre in the hot, humid June season but I can still use it. I love it in the morning right after my hydrating toner when I don‚Äôt want to use a moisturizer right away. Please keep this stocked on SOKO Glam! "
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,Melissa,Combination,25-35, Ok ," I wanted to love this, but it's just ok. It has a medicinal, herbal smell that some people might not care for, but I like it. It just did not provide the amount of hydration and protection I need. This is probably better for people in more humid climates. I will use it but won't repurchase. "
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,Monica,Combination,55+, Love!! , I love this hand cream. I have very dry hands and nothing short of a heavy cream will keep my hands soft and moisturized. I also wash a lot so I need a good cream that doesn't have a lot of perfumes. This cream is light but very hydrating. Leaves my skin really soft and has a natural light smell that doesn't overwhelm me or my dog. I love it! Will be buying more! 
105214036, On Shea Butter and Olive Hand Cream ,Safia,Normal,45-55, Good cream , Good cream. Moisturizes well. Leaves my hands soft. I like how it‚Äôs in a tube dispenser for hygiene. Smells good too!

My skin feels very moisturized when using this with the lotus water cream. As a person with dry skin, it is a nice ‚Äòtreatment lotion‚Äô.

91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,Caroline M.,Combination,<18, Good but not the best ," I had a mediocre experience with this essence. Yes, it is very hydrating- but that was it. I didn't experience or notice any other benefits of cell turnover or depuffing. Also when I finished the bottle, my skin wasn't craving it after a few days of not using it so I don't think it was the best fit for me. "
91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,Waneda O.,Combination,35-44, I like it ," This essence treatment is really nice, leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it comes with a lot of product. "
91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,Jamie,Sensitive,25-35, Multitasking Essence , I like using this as part of my daily skincare routine - 2x a day if I am feeling particularly dry. Typically once a day is enough for me and I also apply a thin layer on my lips underneath lip treatment masks too! 
91716316, On Skin Essentials Activating Treatment Lotion ,Maddy,Dry,35-44," More ""active"" than I expected; slightly irritating "," I was really impressed by the reviews, and was wanting something to give me moisture and glow. However, this made my skin break out in small, irritated bumps. I suspect maybe it's the niacinamide, which can be irritating, and isn't listed in the ""ingredients we love"" so I overlooked it. The formula is much more ""active"" than I anticipated. It felt more like a treatment than a soothing serum ( I get that maybe I misinterpreted the description!) I already use a lot of actives (alternating retinol and other acids, plus vitamin c) so I think this was just too much. The texture is amazing, but it wasn't right for me. "
91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,Mia,Dry,18-24, Hydrating and Calming , It was an unexpectedly good addition to daily skincare routine. Very hydrating and is a great finish to the rest of your skincare. 
91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,Lily,Dry,18-24, Holy Grail! ," Incorporating a face oil into my routine has been a must since I suffer from dry skin. However, it has been a challenge since most face oils clog my pores and cause me to breakout severely. Not this product thought! I have finally found a face oil that works for my skin. This is a multi use oil where I can put it on my cuticles, hands and body and it works just as great. I recently started adding 1-2 drops into my foundation and absolutely love the skin like finish it gives. Definitely check it out! "
91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,Amazon R.,Sensitive,18-24, not great , I was told this oil would be great for barrier repair. It is very drying and to be honest if smells like my eucalyptus essential oil which seems to make my damaged moisture barrier worse. Because you can't return it I feel like I should give it a try for a while longer. 
91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,Sheanna R.,Combination,25-35, Great facial oil , I love this product for my night skincare routine. It feels hydrating and my skin looks more even.

91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,Claire B.,Sensitive,Sensitive, Healing Oil ," I wasn‚Äôt sure this would live up to the hype, but it definitely did! I have extremely sensitive, delicate & reactive skin. A few drops of this oil is all I need to take away any irritation I might have. It also feels like it strengthens my skin barrier so it‚Äôs not as reactive. I love that it‚Äôs fast absorbing and not greasy. It even helps my hands recover faster after rock climbing! I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the pine scent, but for the benefits, I‚Äôll deal with it. So happy I found this product! "

I really wanted an oil that felt moisturizing but also absorbed well and didn't irritate my skin. I usually prefer thicker oils since I do have very dry skin but getting into the warmer months, I didn't want anything too heavy during the days. This was perfect. Just enough moisture without feeling greasy. Not heavy enough for me to use as my night time oil, but great for daytime! "
91716325, On Skin Essentials Barrier Repair Face Oil ,C R.,Dry,35-44, Smells Like Burning Chemicals ," It absorbs well into my face and makes my skin very soft, but I don't know if I can get over the RANCID smell of it. I would say it smells like burning oil, but that's not quite right... more like some kind of mix of burning plastic and burning trash. I will not order again and am sad other oils were out of stock when I placed this order. :( "

292939014, On Skin Essentials Cica Care Balm ,Laura T.,Combination,35-44, Thin smooth textured but powerful results ," My face reddens so easily, even while applying skin care gently and using ingredients I‚Äôm not reactive with, so I thought I‚Äôd try this balm on my ‚Äúred‚Äù mornings before makeup. It works beautifully! My skin is calmer, and it‚Äôs very smooth and hydrated after this balm, day or night. Sometimes I do use an additional moisturizer on top just for better ‚Äúfeel‚Äù at night, but I‚Äôm absolutely buying this again! "
7345210, On Snail Bee High Content Essence ,Sheesha,Sensitive,35-44, Unsure ... ," So I was recommended this product by the concierge as I was looking to get something more intense. I'm currently using the ginseng essence. Whilst it's a concentrated essence and pricey when you see the size of the bottle. Funnily enough, inspite the concentrated texture I didn;t feel it was as hydrating as the ginseng one. I will finish this one (i.e. give it to my husband) and order the ginseng again. The other reviews are very positive so it may be worth trying and not let my review deter anyone. I guess my skin just didn;t take to it. "

7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,Sara M.,Dry,18-24, Caused me to breakout and have little bumps , I really wanted to like this because I thought the ingredients would work well on my skin and it was fairly cheap but I ended up breaking out and having lots of little bumps all over my skin. I have normal-dry skin and it doesn't take a lot for my skin to break out but something about this moisturizer didn't work well for my skin. I am now struggling with breakouts along my forehead and hairline area with little bumps all over my skin (maybe like clogged pores or something like that? just created more texture that I didn't have before). I followed what people said and only used 1 pump every time I used it but still didn't work. 
7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,Maria,Normal,18-24, Amazing ,"I used to use it as my moisturizer for day and night but wanted to experiment on what was causing my breakout so I decided to just use it during the day-- see if using it less would help. When I started doing that, I realized that the breakout started calming down but, obviously, still there since I used it in the morning. I'm now looking for a different moisturizer for the winter time but if you decide to get it just be careful and to test it on your skin slowly! "
7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,Mimi,Sensitive,25-35, I like it so far. , I think I would like it better if it was like a gel moisturizer. I like the feel of it and it doesn‚Äôt feel sticky on my face. Great for sensitive skin. 
7345234, On Snail Bee High Content Lotion ,Trevor,Combination,25-35," Eh, consistency isn't good for daily use "," I wanted to find a daily moisturizer, and this one is a bit too dense. I prefer Innisfree's green tea balancing emulsion and was hoping to find something comparable, hope this would be able to replace it, but again, it's a bit too dense, I had trouble getting it to fully soak into my skin, and my face felt heavy afterwards. I want to use it up, so maybe for a night treatment, but for during the day if you'll be sweating at all - not great. "

It's very thick and creamy, but it doesn't feel like it sits on the skin too long after applying like other thick moisturizers. I have extremely sensitive skin, and when I wake up in the morning after using this, it calms a lot of my breakouts and redness, and my skin doesn't have its winter dry patches anymore. Would definitely recommend for others who have dryer skin in the winter, and are looking for a thicker cream to help out. Only thing that wasn't my favorite is the size, it's quite small, but a little does go a very long way. "

This cream makes me breakout every time. I tried using it consecutively day and night. Just in the morning, just a night. Even in rotation and it STILL made me break out. This was all over the coarse of a year. I don't blame the product entirely though. Everything I have tried with snail mucin has made me break out. It just doesn't agree with my skin. I have acne prone combination skin and this was not it for me. "

I didn't notice any significant differences, and my skin even felt a bit stiff/dry after applying in comparison. The plastic pump/bottle and size is also a bit lacking in terms of what I expected of the product at the price point. I really enjoyed their steam cream, but I'm not sure that I would by this serum again. It didn't make me breakout, but also didn't notice any other pros either. I can imagine for someone else it might work better, but didn't do anything noticeable for me. "
73510125, On Snail Bee Ultimate Serum ,Erin,Combination,25-35, Love but packaging leaks , This product feels wonderful on my skin - truly hydrates without feeling sticky and calms my rosacea. It sits fairly well under makeup after I let it sit for a minute. This would be a holy grail but I‚Äôve lost about half the product while traveling due to it exploding everywhere and seeping out the top from plane pressure. Not sure it‚Äôs worth it due to that unfortunately.

I use it as a moisturizing serum, but it also helps with my skin texture as I am at the lucky age where I am fighting wrinkles AND breakouts. It provides a beautiful glow without getting sticky and layers well with others. I was using a different brand of snail mucin and when I went to restock it was sold out so I got this insead.

The beveled edges mean that they not only adhere to your skin better, but that they blend into any complexion or skin tone almost seamlessly. There are two different sized patches included, and the sheer number of patches (42 for just $6!) makes this product well worth your money; I use them liberally (as one should!) and don't feel guilty about it afterwards because they're so inexpensive. Using these patches at any and every stage of a pimple‚Äîwhen you first notice the blemish emerging, once you've picked at it, and once it has already started to scar‚Äîhas helped my skin heal and get back to normal so much quicker. I cannot recommend this product enough!! "

The cap feels really cheap and flimsy. It feels more like a cap you'd get at a dollar store and for $20, you're essentially paying for the Sokoglam branding. It's a shame because it's really cute, but I can't see it lasting long. It's perfect for bad hair days which is what I'm using it for. "

320422986, On Some by Mi AHA-BHA-PHA 30 Days Miracle Truecica Clear Pad ,Rachael S.,Combination,35-44, This has all of my favorite things! ," I am in love with a specific combination of ingredients for my combo/oily skin that has to go through a lot (like migraine injections every few weeks for one example): Cica + Houttuynia Cordata + Artemisia/Mugwort. Alone these ingredients are good but combined are a powerhouse for preventing or treating breakouts, maskne issues like irritation, and reducing redness and inflammation - all while making my skin feel nourished and not like it is covered in grease. Adding so much tea tree is such a bonus for me too as I'm immunocompromised and keep it in the house to add to practically everything anyway. Also the astringent properties of the Willow Bark is great for my pores on my nose and forehead, yet It isn't drying for my skin, and doesn't make me peel. If it came with the fliptop lid the MadeCera PinkAloe pads come in, or if that lid fits this jar? **chef's kiss** "

I loved the texture and how smooth it was to apply, as well as how it didn't break out my oily acne-prone teen skin. For some reason, after trying a different gel cream moisturizer which i love (Rovectin), I'm not a huge fan of how this one feels on my skin anymore. I currently have acne-prone, combination skin that can get sensitive/dehydrated and this lotion does work well to provide moisture and lock it in, but I feel that the texture on the skin feels a little thick for me. In my opinion, it's also more moisturizing (oil) than hydrating (water) and I'm looking for more hydration. The texture is lightweight and has a milky/buttery(?) creaminess, so it's great for locking in other skincare like toner/essence. If you're looking for a simple no-frills moisturizer I'd 100% give it a try! "

238922174, On Sound Renewal Serum Cream ,Rachel L.,Sensitive,25-35, Nice but underwhelming ," I am torn because I can actually use this without an allergic reaction or breakout, which is so rare for me, but it is kind of blah as far as moisturizers go. I was really hoping for a step up in moisture for the winter, but instead I am adding it as a step before my normal moisturizer. It would be great in the summer or a more humid climate maybe. I do like the feel though! "

Feels super lightweight, but definitely moisturizing and not sticky. I‚Äôve used it with serum and without. I did not experience any dryness. For context, I have combination skin and experiencing fall weather in Canada atm. I like the squeeze type packaging. Only thing is that you gotten be careful to let it stand upright. There is also barely any scent which I appreciate. "

49228997, On Squeeze Green Watery Toner ,Kristi,Combination,25-35, Great toner ," This is a great toner for my combination skin. I feel like it evens out my oily areas while still hydrating the drier sections of my face. It seems to help prevent oil buildup throughout the day as well. I can't say if it's helped with my acne/scarring because I'm using it in combination with so many other products, but it hasn't made it any worse. It smells like alcohol, which can be a turn off to some, but it dissipates pretty quickly. "

As a result, I‚Äôm always on the hunt for the perfect BB cream or tinted moisturizer that gives me all of the sun protection and light coverage without suffocating my skin. This fits the bill. It evens out my skin tone without hiding it, and it gives me an absolutely gorgeous (natural) glow. This is the holy grail for me. (Side note: it does have a bit of scent to it which may turn some off. I‚Äôm usually fairly sensitive to stuff like that but somehow am not bothered here) "

155746016, On Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence ,Mariah K.,Oily,35-44, Good amount of product , It's a good sized tube. It doesn't leave a cast on my skin at all (I'm fair to medium olive tone). It smells like sunscreen for a minute or two after applying and then it has no scent at all. I think the shimmer is far too subtle to really notice honestly. 
155746016, On Sun Project Shimmer Sun Essence ,Maria,Normal,25-35, Leaves white residue on skin ," The consistency and texture is good and it applies really well and under makeup. The one thing I didn't like was after it has absorbed into your skin, it leaves some kind of white residue. I thought at first it was from my tinted moisturizer but I tried not using this sunscreen and I didn't have those white marks. The smell is also a little too sweet for me. "

I used to have ‚Äònormal‚Äô skin, but I noticed it was feeling really dry suddenly. My skin does NOT absorb shea butter very well so was having a hard time finding a moisturizer for dry skin without that ingredient. Gave the Super Ceramide 100 Renewal Cream a try and YES MA‚ÄôAM it works!! And it‚Äôs not heavy feeling AT ALL, which is so surprising considering the thick texture. It isn‚Äôt clogging my pores or any negative impacts on the rest of my skincare routine. I am almost finished with my first tube after around 3 months of use and just bought a second one. My new go-to! "
154020837, On Super Ceramide 100‚Ñ¢ Renewal Cream ,RMC,Sensitive,25-35, Best moisturizer and make-up primer for sensitive skin ," I have sensitive skin (eczema, highly prone to rashes) and this moisturizer is my go-to when I want to hydrate my skin. On the rare occasion that I end up wearing make-up, I always follow my cleanse routine and then use this moisturizer as a primer for a smooth and hydrating base to prevent any flaking for a smooth BB cream application. I don't use this moisturizer daily as it's relatively pricey for less than 2fl oz, but it's great for travel and whenever you feel the need to deeply hydrate. It doesn't leave your skin oily and absorbs quickly, but it does go on thicker than a daily facial lotion. "
154020837, On Super Ceramide 100‚Ñ¢ Renewal Cream ,Elysia L.,Normal,35-44, Heavy but absorbs fast , I like this moisturizer. It is heavier than I am used to but it absorbs fairly quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave my face feelings greasy or oily. 
466824632, On Super Vital Cream Rich ,Chevonne S.,Combination,35-44, Still new to using this product ," I applied it to my face for the first time last night. It was VERY RICH and heavy imo. I am not sure if it is a good or bad thing yet as I would need more time to discern this, but for now, I think it feels too heavy to use during the day time if you're going out. If you're just going to stay home the whole day (or in my case work remotely), then I think it's fine to use it during the day too. But if you plan on heading out shortly after your facial routine, I personally wouldn't use this before an outing as it feels too rich. I will be back to update this after a few weeks/months to see if I see/feel any difference from using this cream. "

25868928, On Supple Preparation All-Over Lotion ,Nick,Sensitive,25-35, Worth the Money ," For a long time I used Eucerin. I have dry, sensitive skin and have a number of allergies, so I've been restricted about what I can use. Eucerin never made me react, so I kept using it despite it only kind of helping my skin (it is not appropriate as a facial moisturiser, though). I tried this, hoping I could find something that would pull double duty so I have one less thing taking up space and I'm very glad I did! It is not only very light on the face, it has that really subtle ""unscented lotion"" smell and - I would say - has slightly less of an odour than the Eucerin, though neither are noticeable or offensive. It has taken care of the persistent dry spots that Eucerin had no impact on! If they ever stop making this, I will be so sad. "

I do love how quickly it absorbs and that it's none greasy. However the texture issues I wanted to target have not improved. I have kept using it for about a year now because it smells good, it's refreshing, absorbs quickly, moisturises with out being sticky and I did not break out. I will continue using it. "
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Judith C.,Dry,25-35, Curious ," I got this moisturizer on a whim, but it actually turned out to be my second fav to my main moisturizer. I like to use this one at night to let it sink in over night. A+ "
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,J,Oily,18-24, New favorite product ," I wasn‚Äôt expecting much when I tried this product on a whim, but it quickly became the favorite out of my routine. I use it day or night, honestly whenever I feel like it. To me, the scent is kind of light and not overbearing. It‚Äôs more somehow more like cucumber than celery. I‚Äôd compare it to the Thayer‚Äôs cucumber toner. As someone with oily skin, I was truly amazed at how matte this leaves my skin. My skin felt moisturized and hydrated, but without that thick shine oilier products can leave. I do feel like when I use it under makeup, my skin overall looks smoother. If you have oily skin, the kind that super shiny and almost tacky throughout the day, I really recommend you give this a try!! It‚Äôs the kind of product that doesn‚Äôt amplify oily skin. "
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Berline A.,Dry,18-24, Nice and Smooth , Very light and smooth! 
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Robin P.,Combination,35-44, Light Moisture , This moisturizer is light and goes on great for day wear under makeup. Has a light and refreshing smell. My skin stays moisturized and not oily by end of the day. 
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Elis T.,Dry,<18, Okay cream , I gave this to my sister and this is what she said: It is not enough for my dry skin but did help a little. Has a very strong scent of celery but disappears in minutes (smelt good for me but it depends on your preference) The cream helped minimize my chicken skin around my eyes. 
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Alice,Combination,25-35, Ok ," I really wanted to love this moisturizer as I love the cocokind essence. I love this brand as well. However, this cream made my skin feel tight and was not moisturizing enough. I also could not stand the smell. It was just too much for me. "
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Abby,Combination,35-44, Nice Daytime Moisturizer ," I enjoy the feel of the product going on, it absorbs quickly and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. A little goes a long way. My only complaint is that I don't love the smell. I find there is a distinct celery smell when applying. It doesn't linger beyond that and certainly isn't enough to deter me from using it as my go-to morning moisturizer. "
238343504, On Texture Smoothing Cream ,Alyssa,Normal,18-24, Good and good , This moisturizer is simply just good! It takes a few seconds for it to really soak into the skin but what I like about it is that a little goes a very long way so you don‚Äôt need that much. I am not a fan of the celery smell but it takes a few to get used to. It‚Äôs hydrating and definitely brings life back to the face but there is just something missing that makes it great. If you‚Äôre looking for something simple this is good but because of the texture this might not be good for very oily skin!

I have dry skin and I have tried hyaluronic acid from different brands before and they didn‚Äôt work out as well. The more I used this one by Cosrx, the more I felt my skin was getting drier and drier. I tried to use it in different steps of my skin care step and searched how to use it for people with dry skin. I even tried using this when my skin was a bit wet. When I have it on my skin, it seems ok, still not hydrating, but once I wash my face, my face seems terribly dry. "

I got this book to read together and help us look into our relations, as well as developing more empathy for others. This book has also helped us learn more about his culture. I am really appreciative of that and being able to use this book to learn new things and bond with my partner. It‚Äôs greatly written and leaves you feeling positive and hopeful in a world that often leaves you disheartened. Thanks Charlotte Cho! "

I‚Äôve been a fan of Charlotte for a while, but ever since I‚Äôve gotten so involved in Korean skincare and entertainment, this book and the idea of Jeong always intrigued me. So I purchased it from audible. I had no idea what this meant and now I‚Äôve learnt to appreciate these feelings of sentiments, attachment, bonds and affection much more than I ever did before. It definitely reminds you to live with purpose. It helped me to remember all the Jeong and connection I‚Äôve made/experienced at several moments in my own life. Not only that, but I think the author gave some really good advice of not feeling manipulated by Jeong in a way in which you feel indebted / pressured but instead to stay firm by setting certain limits. All I want to say is thank you to Charlotte opening this window to Jeong for me! :) Your journey is very inspiring! x "

I was really, REALLY apprehensive trying retinol, as I have read many horror stories (it took me almost a month to try it!), but with the lack of sleep I have been experiencing lately, I wanted to give it a try. WOWWWW!!! This morning my face was smooth and my enlarged pores had shrunk! I looked at the areas where I had placed the product, and the wrinkles were replaced with smooth skin!

Smoother than the texture you would get with disposables, if you prefer the light exfoliation. After one wash they already got a little wavy, and the tags stick out, but still function well. I used the net bag they came in to wash them as well, and about half of them escaped during wash, hahaha. So I will have to use one with a zipper. Unsure if worth the price, but I am always glad to add a reusable item to my drawer. "

I LOVE IT. I really think this gets my skin ready for my serums, moisturizer and SPF. I use this basically as a toner and have noticed subtle changes.

However, it might just be me and my skin type, but I question if this is for everyday use. By my third night using it (I personally use it day + night) I think it really threw my skin into a frenzy and this has caused my skin's ph to be thrown off wack so maybe this can be just a night cleanser or a 2x a week cleanser.

Beautiful bottle, smells nice (don't think there's added fragrance) and great size (thought i would get a sample but thanks for the full size soko glam!) I really like using it; I'm into antioxidant rich toners which I believe this counts, and yes I said its a toner I'm sorry but essences are fancy synonyms for toners I said what I said. Don't know if I see a difference in my acne oily combo skin but it's a great way to wipe off excess dirt and makeup without stripping the skin. Unsure if I would purchase though. "
142491278, On Time Revolution Artemisia Treatment Essence ,Atinla,Combination,25-35, Worth the $$ ," I'll start off by saying this is by far the most expensive product in my skincare line at $55. I first bought this for $30 at TJ Maxx and even then thought.... wow this is a lot (separately, would recommend checking your local TJ Maxx/Marshalls for Korean skicare b/c I've seen some Cosrx and Missha products among others pop up in the last year!). I could say unfortunatley I fell in love with it because now I'm shelling out the $$ haha :) One bottle lasts me 7 months though, so if you wait for sales or stock up your points to redeem for this product it really isn't that expensive to only spend it twice a year! This is a super lightweight essence (more akin to a toner I suppose). I use it as my first step in my morning routine. I've come to love the earthy smell - and of course I just immediately fell in love with the packaging itself! Wow it just feels so classy with the brown frosted glass packaging (the glass is, I suspect, the main reason for the high price). The ingredient is almost 100% mugwort extract, which I didn't know what it was until looking into it and I'm glad I purchased and discovered this ingredient! I think it's really helped clear any acne from my skin and combat the small breakouts I do infrequently get. Again, I know it's pricey but the ingredient is one you should include in your skincare (from Missha or elsewhere), and one bottle lasts about 6-7 months! I would recommed you at least try a bottle and see if your skin benefits :) "

942397, On Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule 5X ,Jacqueline S.,Normal,35-44, Holy grail , This is one of those holy grail products. I naturally have combination skin but my moisture barrier is completely wrecked right now so I needed some thing that could improve things without being too harsh or too greasy. This completely addressed my texture problems and eliminated my fine lines all without not being too greasy. This stuff is liquid gold. 
942397, On Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule 5X ,Shawna,Dry,25-35, Good stuff , Feels good on the skin. A little goes a long way. 
942397, On Time Revolution Night Repair Ampoule 5X ,Sab,Oily,35-44, my first review ever (like .... ever) ," In the past months I've become a chronic skin picker and THIS have absolutely saved my skin. I have pretty sensitive skin so I don't like to splurge on a product in case it irritates my skin, but this recent black friday I was running out of my hyaluronic acid serum and decided to purchase this as a replacement. Each day my skin looks clearer, less red, and has less scars than the day before. I have dry-combo skin so I will add this isn't as moisturizing as I thought, so for dry skin I would recommend pairing this with a moisturizing essence. "
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Jennifer S.,Sensitive,35-44, In Love ," I have very reactive, sensitive skin along with melasma. I‚Äôve been using this daily for two weeks. I now add it to my d√©collet√© after my showers. I love this stuff. I‚Äôm already addicted. "
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Amy R.,Oily,25-35, Love this essence , I really like this essence. It absorbs well and my skin feels a more moisturized after using it. 
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Maria,Dry,35-44, Luxe and effective! ," I've been wanting to try this for awhile, and I'm so glad I finally got it! I only wish I started using it sooner. I feel like even with my acne scars that are taking a long time to fade, my skin still somehow is just so healthy looking since I've started using it. The bottle itself is so lovely to hold, I feel so fancy when I use it. Such a treat! "
570568, On Time Revolution The First Essence 5x ,Alyssa,Normal,25-35, Amazing ," This made a noticeable difference in my acneic skin in a short amount of time, and it feels so luxurious. Fast absorbing, so that makes it easy to layer quickly under moisturizer or SPF. Love this stuff! "

43989137, On Time Stop Collagen Ampoule ,Mariya,Dry,35-44, staple , This is my staple and I buy several bottles at once. Makes a visible difference in my skin. 
43989137, On Time Stop Collagen Ampoule ,CC,Normal,25-35, Moisturizing , Moisturizing and dried quick on the skin. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth the price though so I have yet to repurchase and probably would not be repurchasing. 
248634603, On Time Stop Peptide Eye Cream For Face ,Calvin C.,Oily,25-35, Works really well , My dark circles have mostly disappeared and my eyes are looking so much tighter in the areas I use it on. I'm not sure how to describe it but it really leave the eyes looking youthful and tight on the skin. 
248634603, On Time Stop Peptide Eye Cream For Face ,Rayleigh,Oily,25-35, Wonderful eye cream ," This eye cream is very rich and keeps my eye area VERY hydrated. It doesn't really help that my skin is oily and I don't really have any dryness concerns around the eyes, so it can get a bit 'greasy' in appearance. I still do like and recommend this eye cream, but to those that have very dry under eye areas. I will keep using this product, along with applying it to my face and neck...why not? It's great to also apply in these areas. "
248634603, On Time Stop Peptide Eye Cream For Face ,Sara,Normal,25-35, Not very thick ," This eye cream is just okay ‚Äî it‚Äôs not that hydrating and had a gel like, watery texture. Would prefer something thicker "
344610073, On Tonal Scenery Reparative Serum ,Trishina R.,Dry,25-35, Glow , Loving this serum. After applying my skin is glowing. I've been applying at night after cleansing and toning. Makes my skin feel soft and is not sticky. will continue using. 
344610073, On Tonal Scenery Reparative Serum ,Lilly,Sensitive,18-24," Not sure how much it does, but it feels good ", Feels great going on and soaks in immediately! I haven‚Äôt noticed any brightening (which is what I bought it for) but that may be a more long-term result. It‚Äôs really expensive but didn‚Äôt break me out. Definitely hydrating and I love the way the little beads dissolve. Just way too expensive for what it is. But I‚Äôm reordering to see if it has a more noticeable effect after another few months. 
344610073, On Tonal Scenery Reparative Serum ,Asia,Combination,18-24, Expensive without results , I have combination/sensitive skin that loves all the things this product is supposed to deliver however it just left me with tiny whiteheads every time I used it. I will say the texture is a bit thicker than water and it did leave my skin feeling hydrated 
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Kathy,Combination,18-24, My favorite cotton pads! , These are the only ones I use. I love how there's two textures to fit your routine.

18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Anh N.,Dry,35-44, Love this ," Love the two types of cotton pads you get. One I use to wipe things off my face and the other to use with my toner, which makes me use less product too. I always have a backup box. "
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Vivian O.,Dry,25-35, Perfect cotton pads ," Not sure how they came up with these but they‚Äôre amazing! They hold the perfect amount of toner and essence so that just a few drops can be applied to your whole face. My product is distributed just as evenly (if not more) than regular cotton pads, but I‚Äôm using significantly more product. I‚Äôll never use other cotton pads again "
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Ren,Combination,25-35, Wow! , I love the sponge ones for depositing my toner without absorbing it. Makes it so easy to spread. The traditional pads I use for areas I feel are more ‚Äúdirty‚Äù like my neck to remove SPF and makeup when I‚Äôm not hopping in the shower in my night routine. They‚Äôre sooo good! 
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,koleelor,Combination,25-35, my favorite cotton pads , i love these cotton pads. doesn't leave fuzzies and also doesn't just suck up all of your product leaving you with less product for your face. i used it with some aloe vera to wipe away my hair from my face after plucking and it picked up all of the hair. this lasted me so long too 
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Tina W.,Normal,>55, Best pads ," The pressed pad is great for toners sweeping across skin, the fluffy pad is good for pressing essence into skin, my favorite pads, don‚Äôt leave fuzz and is stiff enough to sweep, no shredding doesn‚Äôt soak up too much product being wasteful, can‚Äôt beat the price "
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Jessica,Normal,25-35, 2 sides ," I have enjoyed the compressed cotton pad SO much, I use it to apply my toner and I find I use an optimal amount of product and less waste. I have been using these pads for about a month now "
18129067, On Toner Mate 2 in 1 Cotton Pad ,Alia M.,Combination,35-44, These are Brilliant! ," I purchased these toner pads after reading a blog post about them on The Klog. They are absolutely amazing and do everything they claim to do! The box comes with over 100 toner pads. Half of the pads are thin with a durable consistency, almost like stock paper. When I apply my cleansing toner to this pad it does what it's meant to do, cleanses by wiping away any cleanser or dirt/makeup you may have missed during cleansing. "
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Nicole D.,Normal,55+, I need this , This essence is super hydrating and it leaves my skin feeling plump and soft. At nighttime I like to layer it 3x. I also keep the bottle in my skincare fridge so when I splash it on my face and neck it feels amazing. I have normal skin so this works perfect for me. 
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Lisa,Dry,35-44, Good Pick for A Minimalist Routine that wants Galactomyces ," I got interested in this after Kelly Driscoll mentioned it -- I swear by galactomyces in my routine because it really helps with my pore size and skin brightness. I've been using this, functionally, as a first treatment essence (think Missha, SK-II etc). It's a bit heavy for that, frankly, but layers beautifully. I appreciate that it adds other ferments, niacinamide and sea buckthorn extract, too, because this makes it a go-to on days when I'm feeling a shorter routine. "
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Camille,Sensitive,25-35, Excellent pour peau sensible , Hydrate et pr√©pare bien ma peau √† mes s√©rums 
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,Anh V.,Combination,45-55, Brightens up your complexion , I usually skip the toner when I double cleanse and go straight to this essence. It is very hydrating and does not leave a sticky residue that interferes with your serums or creams. 
114406892, On Tri-Bio Treatment Essence ,El.,Combination,25-35, You get your money's worth! ," I was hesitant to purchase this as it is a bit pricey for me, but there is a lot of product in the bottle! My skin breaks out easily and is on the dryer side. This was very moisturizing and smoothing and didn't leave a sticky film! I typically don't like the way toners feel but this one is amazing! I definitely felt like this made my skin more smooth and healthy. Once the bottle was gone I noticed that my skin wasn't as bright. Worth repurchasing! "

49889646, On Triplex Natural Shampoo ,Shelby D.,Sensitive,25-35, This + Tea Tree Scalp Pack = No Dandruff ," I have been struggling with dandruff caused by eczema for a couple of years now. At one point it was so bad that even if I put my hair up, flakes would rain down during the day. I had scabs on the back of my scalp that were eczema build-ups. I was so embarrassed. On a whim, I got this and the Tea Tree Scalp Pack (also sold here and made by the same company) and it has been such a game-changer. I have ZERO flakiness and no more itchy, irritated scalp or eczema a build-up. It is literally so amazing! It very gently suds but still cleans all my hair care products out effectively. For me, with short hair, a little goes a long way. I have about a third of the bottle left and that has taken me 3 months of every-other-day use to get down that low. I am buying more in anticipation of running out because I do not want to be without this combo. I really hope they sell a larger size soon!! It should also be noted I use a scalp massager (I bought it at TJ Maxx for 4 bucks) to go with this since my long nails were sometimes scratching my scalp too hard. Would also totally recommend one of those because it gently exfoliates your scalp and prevents flaky build-up! "
49889646, On Triplex Natural Shampoo ,Nicole,Dry,25-35, Would honestly buy if it was bigger ," This was really nice to use. I used it both with mid-back length, thick hair and after a big haircut that left it jawline short. Both cases, double wash as recommended was always needed because the first would never lather and the amt of product you go through to get a decent lather or remove products with certainty was a little too annoying. It's a very small bottle (for those of us who grew up with costco-sized pantene, this looks like shampoo for a doll), but I'd honestly buy more if the option for larger bottles or 36oz pumps was offered. The smell was also really nice and soothing for a shower. "

Initially, I thought it was from stress, but once I stopped using it, hair loss was extremely less. This was just my own experience. I believe this product is made with sulfates. I would not recommend this product. "

57742572, On Trouble Cure ,Robyn,Dry,25-35, AMAZING for Cystic/hormonal acne ," If i could give this product a 6//5 I would! I get regular hormonal, cystic pimples that I cannot pop but hurt (usually around my ears, jawline, and nose). They are the worst but these patches have been the only thing to quickly clear them up. I adore these patches so much. I have found that, for the really bad cystic pimples, they reduce them significantly and, for the average pimples, they clear up them up entirely. If I have a really gnarly one, I will use the cleaning wipe to clean the area after double cleansing then I will put a tiny drop of salicylic acid, which I let dry, then i put the patch over and it works like a charm. AMAZING! "
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,emma,Sensitive,18-24, works so well , these honestly work so much better than i ever expected. they really help to get rid of blemishes overnight. 
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,Ellie L.,Normal,25-35, A true life-saver ," These patches are INCREDIBLE. They're a bit expensive, so I save them for when they're really needed, but I love them. They're the only thing that I've used that really get at the deeper, cystic-type acne. "
57742572, On Trouble Cure ,Makaela,Sensitive,25-35," Not as good as ZitSticka, but still works "," I tackle my cystic acne with microdart patches and love the results. These patches are effective, but not as effectiveas ZitSticka patches. These have smaller microdarts. "
246695666, On True Water Deep Moisture Cream EX ,Nicole H.,Combination,25-35, Don't waste your money ," This product is definitely not worth the price tag. I really liked their gel mask as an overnight mask which works wonderfully so I gave this a try. So disappointed. Even though it's winter, other products I've used as my last step have held up well for most of the day. With this, I'm lucky if I get two hours before my skin feels like paper. "

I have used this stick day and night for the suggested 20 mins, and have seen a noticeable difference in the fading of my dark spots. It always helps with spot treatment for pimples. I‚Äôm going to stick up on this ! "
238343680, On Turmeric Stick ,Claire S.,Combination,25-35, Better than I thought! ," I got this mostly as an easy way to bring a face mask once travelling again. Glad I did, because it turns out it makes a great spot treatment for me! Non-drying, no breakouts - does bring some stuff to the surface obviously, but for me it then disappears within a day- and the easiest mask you will ever apply. It is very yellow when you put it on, but it comes off with a damp cotton ball or cotton pad. Do note that it will stain reusable cotton rounds. "

238343680, On Turmeric Stick ,Molly,Dry,35-44," Requires washing off, but seems to work "," I agree with other reviewers that this stick mask definitely turns your face turmeric colored. That said, I used a gentle cleanser‚Äîtwo times‚Äîto wash off the mask and was good to go with no yellow residue.  "
238343680, On Turmeric Stick ,Pip,Combination,18-24, ,"As someone who studied Ayurveda, I appreciate the known efficacy of turmeric, and the stick does make the application less messy and stain-prone.

80333124, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Emulsion ,Emma P.,Sensitive,18-24, Alittle thick , It‚Äôs thicker than the Dr.Oracle emulsion which is ok... but I like the thin consistency on dr. Oracle. I have sensitive/combo skin and sometimes it comes with hormonal acne but other than that this is a really good emulsion. If another emulsion comes out that I know i won‚Äôt be a fan of then I‚Äôll probably just keep using this one for my T-zone ( I use the skin rxlab pink tube moisturizer for my inflamed cheeks)

80333124, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Emulsion ,Helen K.,Combination,35-44, Found my lotion...finally ," I was hesitant to switch lotions as I had one that worked okay, but was a tad greasy. After lots of research on Soko Glam, decided to try the Dewytree emulsion lotion. Love that you don't need a lot of this product, it doesn't feel greasy, doesn't cause breakouts, and leaves my skin with a dewy look/feel which I have never been able to achieve before. Still a work in progress, but this lotion helps a lot along with the whole routine.  "
80333124, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Emulsion ,Melissa D.,Combination,45-55, Super hydrating ,"Perfect for combo skin. I do not have increased breakouts with this lotion, feels lightweight, works great under sunscreen and makeup (when I wear it). Also works well with sensitive skin and dry patches. I've never had redness with this product, and on a recent trip I really missed using this! The bottle is nice, stores easily and only pumps out enough lotion for your needs so you aren't wasting any product. As I always say...wish there was a travel size option available but I'll be repacking this one into a tinier bottle in the future if I ever need to do so. "
80333124, On Ultra Vitalizing Snail Emulsion ,Elizabeth L.,Combination,25-35, Favorite ,"Product is more expensive, however the bottle is 5 oz and like I said above, you don't need a lot so I can see this lasting a long time.

It's incredibly hydrating and is doing wonders for keeping ageing at bay. There is fragrance, but it's very subtle and goes away almost immediately. IMO, better than CosRX's similar product.

Will probably try something different next. "
301806428, On V.Biome Advanced Eye Cream ,Jane S.,Combination,18-24, Hydrating ," A decent thick and hydrating eye cream. Feels nice, no bad smell. I just have to be careful not to get milia since it's thick. I noticed a few bumps develop under one eye, but should be okay if used in very small amounts. Not that I ever used that much! But something to note. Really the tiniest amount is enough if you're like me. I have sensitive skin, though. "

301806146, On V.Biome Firming Cream ,Trang P.,Combination,25-35, Decent moisturizer. Not a fan of the stick in it ," The moisturizer I would say is good for autumn. For the winter, you might need some extra layers (ie. Essence etc). The jar is more on the tall cylinder side. It has an interesting stick to grab the moisturizer but it's harder to grab enough in one go. (Or maybe I am supposed to use my fingers and use the stick when the cream is running low). "

I CANNOT live without this product. I use it mostly as a spot treatment but will occasionally use it all over my face. I feel like it's most effective as a spot treatment. I experience hormonal breakouts and will sometimes have a really deep cystic spot beginning to form. When that happens I will spot treat the area with this at night. If I can tell the breakout has extra potential, I'll use a tiny dab of it in the morning. This product makes my breakout completely disappear, and quickly.

I was afraid of retinol being too strong and irritating but I experienced no stinging. I was careful to not get too close to the eyes because I didn't want to risk getting some in my eye. I recommend it for anyone who is concerned with fine lines around the eye area. I also used it on my smile lines. :)

When I wake, my under eyes are supple and fine lines are less visible.

Lately, I started to feel like my skin was sagging round eyelids and on neck. It was a stressful year and it shows in ways it never has before. I decided to try this cream in an attempt to delay further sagging and tighten up my skin. I previously used very basic eye creams but nothing specifically like this or this expensive. I think the size of the tube is good ‚Äîalthough not sure how much I can use on my neck. It does burn a bit when I get it in my eyes and makes them tear. Wrinkles seem lighter but I‚Äôve also changed face washes, toner, and serum (all from SOKO!) so it might be a combo of revamping my skin care which I do every 6 months. I‚Äôll update in a few weeks once I have consistently used! "

185927545, On Vitamin C Glow Powder Cleanser ,Maria,Dry,25-35, Gentle exfoliating cleanser , I got a free sample of this from one of my orders and decided to try it out since I was looking for an exfoliating cleanser that's gentle and doesn't irritate my skin. I was a little skeptical if it would work for me since I haven't used a powdered formula for a cleanser so this is just something new. It lathers really well when you put some water on it and I like how it feels on my face. I didn't have any reactions and my face felt clean and bright after using it. I use this every other day after my regular facial cleanser and my face doesn't feel dry and tight after. I have been using this for almost a year now and I still have some left so definitely worth it!

257582691, On Vitamin Tree Water Gel Cream ,Vivian,Dry,25-35, Pretty good but not amazing ," I have only been using this product for a few days, so my opinion is still fairly undeveloped but I don‚Äôt love this product personally. I do enjoy it though. It‚Äôs unscented, applies as a thin gel that dries down quickly, and has not irritated my sensitive skin. What it lacks is moisturizing power. I have very dry skin and this product is just not enough to leave my face feeling fully hydrated. That being said, I will definitely continue to use it as a layer because I think it does have a bit of brightening power and it is a decent moisturizer as part of a full routine. Would probably be perfect for someone with oily skin because it dries quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave much residue but for dry skin in cold weather, you‚Äôll definitely need something more than just this to keep your skin refreshed.

A little goes such a long way if you lather it with water. When I feel like I need a deeper cleanse, I‚Äôll use more and rub the oil in before lathering. It never dries my skin out, has a subtle, clean scent that I honestly love, and the packaging is great - you don‚Äôt have to worry about squeezing out too much accidentally!  "

(RIP to a great one. It was discontinued five years ago and I'm still in mourning.) Every other cleanser has just been... there. Fine. I'd notice a bad one, but never found any that were particularly good. Until this one. I love the way my skin feels after using this. It's noticeable every single time. It feels clean and smooth and soft without feeling like there's residue left behind. I love the bottle. It's easy to dispense and allows for more control than a pump. I also just really like the aesthetic of this plain grey bottle for reasons that I don't entirely understand. "

I did not repurchase because at the time my acne was very inflamed and I wanted to focus on calming. However, now that it‚Äôs been a while and my skin is under control I will be repurchasing in the future! "

It‚Äôs not too thin either, but the perfect in between texture that I, as someone with super oily skin, appreciate. It doesn‚Äôt leave my skin seeming shiny or full of product, so it works well in the morning and under makeup or at night before bed. I also am prone to breakouts and haven‚Äôt had to worry about this causing any. I use a whole bunch of products, so I can‚Äôt say specifically if I‚Äôve noticed a huge change in my skin from this one, but I really enjoy using it as just a general moisturizer. I do also appreciate that it‚Äôs not full of heavy perfumes and oils which was what drew me to it. I will be purchasing again when I run out and would for sure recommend this. "

When I first read the reviews, I kind of rolled my eyes and thought, yeah, right. It seems a bit too good to be true. I suffer from extremely dry skin, so bad that it will flake off. I have to exfoliate daily. I have a makeup table full of moisturizers and exfoliators to try and tame it. When I took the chance on this one, I didn't believe that it would do much good, but I was wrong. In the last three months, I have been able to cut down to exfoliating my face from daily to once a week, and I've gone down to one good moisturizer that I know works well with my skin. My skin not only feels hydrated, but it looks hydrated as well. The firmness and elasticity in my skin have improved as well. I don't have a lot of wrinkles; however, the ones that I do have, are visibly reduced. Overall, this has been a really great purchase for me so I will continue to use it going forward. "

I am using this because it has Bakucihol, a natural retinol alternative (I tried retinol in the past and didn't like it. My skin became irritated). This helps with strengthening the skin barrier, stimulating cell turnover, and targeting hyperpigmentation. I've also seen a difference in how hydrated my skin looks. It also plumps skin for a more youthful complexion, something I appreciate. I also have redness in my skin and this has carrot, morringa seed, and blue tansy oils to help bring relief to redness and irritation.

165043857, On Wonder Balm ,Cara,Normal,45-55, please never stop selling this! ," this does wonderful things for my long breakage prone hair. What I really love about this product is that it can be used in a variety of ways successfully. First can be used as a deep conditioning treatment after shampooing with a clarifying shampoo and left on for a length of time and rinsed out. Second it can be used as a regular conditioner left on after shampooing for however long you leave on your conditioner in the shower and then rinse out. Lastly it can be used as a leave in conditioner now this is where it gets really special- on wet hair or on dry as a smoothing balm. I tried to extend the life of my blown out hair and by Day four, My hair is screaming for more moisture. To survive that fourth day I will put some of this balm in- sometimes with a little water sometimes without. What can I say I‚Äôm a mad scientist. "
165043857, On Wonder Balm ,Michelle,Dry,18-24, ACTUALLY WORTH IT. ," i‚Äôve bought many things from soko glam just for fun and honestly, most things didn‚Äôt work for me and was ultimately a waste of money. However, i‚Äôve had this product for over a year (a little goes a long way) and it‚Äôs sooo good. I dye/bleach my hair pretty often and it can look really damaged and dry, but using this after a shower really helps. I also like how easy it is to use because I don‚Äôt have the patience to use products that have to be used in between the shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend this product! Your hair will look and feel sooo soft üòç "
165043857, On Wonder Balm ,Daniel,Combination,25-35, Hair feels great ," This product lasts a while since I use it once or twice a week, but my hair is noticeably healthier especially with the scalp treatment. My hair feels thicker and softer throughout the week and it feels great. "

If you do feel like trying it, buy it from another company because returns with soko glam are a joke and they make it virtually impossible to do. "

231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Anastasiia,Sensitive,45-55, Visible Difference!! ," I love this toner. It makes my skin so soft, plump, and dewy. It feels a little bit more like a super liquidy lotion so I tend to put a light toner on first then follow it with this toner. "
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Michelle,Sensitive,25-35, Been a while since I've had this great of a toner ," This is my first time trying this toner and so far it has made my skin feel very smooth, moisturized, and not overly sensitive. A moisturizer I bought a while ago is taking my skin some time to get used to but when I use it after using this toner, it makes my skin feel very soft. I have been using it with a cotton pad and swiping away any leftover dirt or impurities but some days I pat into my skin so it'll absorb it and both ways have been great so far. I will probably purchase this toner again in the future. "
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Tonya,Combination,25-35, What did I just put on my face?!!! ," I normally don‚Äôt write reviews after a couple uses (or at all), but I had to share this! The bottle really is huge so the price point is great. I used to use Good Light Moon Glow (which I loved) but I started using prescription Retinol (tret) a month ago so I‚Äôm taking taking a break from AHAs and BHAs. Since starting the tret my skin got dryer and more sensitive (as expected), but after just one use this toner made my skin feel hydrated, smooth and bouncy. I had no idea what ‚Äúbouncy‚Äù skin was before trying this! It‚Äôs not sticky or tacky and dries quickly and feels cool. You can layer this multiple times depending on your moisturizing needs and it sits really well with makeup. More oily skin types may not even need to use any other moisturizer with this product. There was a subtle, but noticeable difference in redness as well. I personally don‚Äôt notice much of a fragrance but there is a light clean/citrus scent if I sniff the bottle, it does have EOs if you‚Äôre sensitive to them. I‚Äôm really glad I purchased this, especially living in a climate where it‚Äôs about to get cold and dry soon. I highly recommend this if you‚Äôre looking for something to smooth out and negate dry skin. "
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Veronica,Combination,25-35, Great bang for your buck ," This toner leaves your skin so soft and supple! Light scent, does not irritate my skin which tends to be sensitive. If you are suuuuper sensitive to fragrance, maybe it can be irritating. Great as that first layer of moisture that you follow up with a moisturizer to really lock in. The bottle is so big as well, this is lasting me a very long time! I even sometimes use it on my body before lotion. Great product, no complaints here. :) "
231853388, On Wonder Ceramide Mochi Toner ,Nicole M.,Oily,18-24, amazing!! ," i used to use the rice toner from tonymoly before this and i loved it but decided to try this one after running out of the rice one, and i love it so much!! the consistency is kind of like thick water? lol but it‚Äôs soo hydrating but not greasy as i have oily skin. it makes my skin feel so smooth after it dries down! i also have a lot of redness and this toner helps to calm it down, i love it so much i‚Äôm definitely going to keep rebuying it! plus the bottle is literally huge so i know it‚Äôs going to last me so long. would definitely recommend this toner! :) "

The amount of compliments I get on my hair nowwww, this is my first and last hair oil. my frizz is under control, and my hair is so shiny and soft. A little goes a real long way so be careful, or else it could look and feel oily instead. I use it when my hair is damp, before blow drying. "
165043867, On Wonder Hair Oil ,Rianna,Normal,25-35, love this hair oil!! ," I have fine, long hair, color treated at the ends. I found this made my hair incredibly soft and shiny - I use a little bit post-wash, pre-dry. I find it absorbs fine and doesn't leave any oiliness when I use it then. I use a larger amount pre-wash: rub into hair a few hours before showering, it doesn't absorb fast this way, but I think it contributes to keeping my hair moisturized and sleek! Love love love this hair oil. "

I LOVED IT! Perfect gel consistency, not too thick and not too watery. Nice citrusy scent.

I've used other gel peelers before, the same kind where you are supposed to ""rub off"" dead skin and it just rolls up. I usually love them, but my favorite one has been out of stock so I tried this product. It did not work at all, it feels like it is rolling up/ pill-ing up into little bits as soon as it is out of the tube? It does not actually seem like it is rolling off any skin, the product is just clumping up like elmers glue. Very sad I kept trying it again every week or so, hoping I was mis-remembering. But no, every time it just did not work out. "

I took the skincare quiz and this was one of the recommended products. My skin has been a bit dull and I wanted an exfoliant that was gentle and effective. This is incredible. Seeing the dead skin come off was insane, and then feeling how soft my skin was afterwards? I could hardly believe it. The rest of my products went on so smooth; it‚Äôs like this product made the rest of my routine even more effective. I have semi-sensitive, combination skin and had no breakouts or intense redness.
